3,"Why Billionaire Jim Mellon Is Predicting The End Of Meat, Dairy And Fish In 10 Years",https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/food/billionaire-jim-mellon-end-of-dairy/,2021-07-21,"British billionaire and investor Jim Mellon is certain the future will be free from the clutches of the meat and dairy industries. Here’s why. According to Mellon’s predictions, the food industry is set to see some big changes over the next decade. The 64-year-old has helped create and support huge biotechnology companies, some of which aim to extend human life longevity. He’s also the largest shareholder in Agronomics, an investment company focussed on expanding ‘modern foods’ – aka cell-cultured meat. Additionally, his book Moo’s Law provides an ‘investor’s guide to the new agrarian revolution’. First, the dairy industry as we know it – where cows produce milk – ‘will be gone’, he says. This is because alternative plant milks, such as almond and soy, will take over. Or, they will be made using precision fermentation, a technology using microbial hosts as cell factories, in order to create an identical protein. One of the leaders in the dairy fermentation industry is Change Foods, a brand aiming to create ‘mind-blowing animal-free foods’ that are better for the planet. Secondly, Mellon predicts the meat industry will collapse. Half of it will consist of plant-based foods, or foods made using cellular agriculture, he claims. ‘We already have the products. All we need is the scale, the money, and the will’, he says. The views were shared in a TikTok video on Dubai Future Foundation. But the mogul has also been speaking out with a host of media outlets. Author & billionaire investor Jim Mellon runs the largest cellular agriculture investment firm in the world. #future #food #science Cellular technology is largely considered as providing an answer to ending factory farming and destructive animal agriculture for good. It’s expanded as the wider plant-based movement has witnessed staggering growth in recent years. Renowned companies leading the change include Oatly, with its soaring shares on its IPO debut: at an estimated £1 billion. Moreover, supermarkets, stores, and schemes are all contributing to hiking customer demand. And changing perspectives on the environment are leading people to rethink their food choices like never before. Additionally, vast investments are becoming more frequent into vegan giants – allowing more funds to be funneled into product development. The cell-based and industry is especially booming, and it’s expected to reach full price parity by 2035. This is in line with wider predictions that 11 percent of traditionally animal-based products will be spawn from alternative protein technology. Even food giants such as Nestlé are expanding into it. Additionally, it’s not just cellular meat and dairy that are on the rise. Cell-based seafood brands are ramping up production across borders as well. It’s followed a host of celebrities advocating for marine health since the debut of the hit Netflix documentary, Seaspiracy. Dubbed the ‘start of a global shift’, it’s become evident that increasing people are concerned about overfishing and ocean health. And this is Jim Mellon’s third prediction: that half the world’s fish will be produced in factories by 2040. Despite this, many vegans remain conflicted about it. As the meat is made from animal cells, some disagree because they feel it is unethical. Others are concerned it ‘messes around with nature’. I will not eat cultured meat but if it brings down industrial animal farming, I'm all for it as an alternative. I think we're a long way from the world's populations eating only plant-based food, so this could help reduce the scale of animal suffering and abuse. Either way, cell-cultured meat is here to stay. And, if billionaire businessman Jim Mellon is correct, it will mark the start of a transformed agricultural system. "
15,Is The Future Lab-Grown? From Meat To Diamonds: Meet The Companies Leading The Way,https://plantbasednews.org/news/tech/is-the-future-lab-grown-from-meat-to-diamonds/,2021-07-18,"Cellular agriculture, aka lab-grown meat and dairy, will transform animal agriculture. It shifts production away from farming animals to instead focus on processes at the cellular level. Think tank Blue Horizon suggests that by 2035 ‘every tenth portion of meat, eggs, and dairy eaten around the globe is very likely to be alternative’. Questions remain about the technology. Is it artificial? Will people accept it? Is it better or worse for the environment? Some answers are becoming clearer every day. Not only in terms of the food we eat. Yes, most ‘lab-grown’ tech companies are working to produce animal-derived agricultural products (‘meat’, ‘leather’, ‘milk’, ‘eggs’ etc.). But, there’s a whole world of innovation in other areas.  That is good news for animals and the plant-based community. It helps make ‘lab-grown’ an acceptable idea. Let’s begin with diamonds. Earlier this year, Pandora, the world’s largest jewelry company, announced that, going forward, it would only use lab-created diamonds, and not mined diamonds. Lab-grown diamonds have been around since the 1950s. But high energy costs and a lack of ability to create ‘pretty’ diamonds meant they were mainly used in industry, such as drill bits on heavy machinery. But as with lab-grown meat, technology has advanced and costs have come down. Now lab-grown diamonds are helping consumers avoid the environmental and ethical problems associated with the ‘natural’ product. The charity Human Rights Watch reports that even today most jewelry companies can’t assure its customers that its diamonds are free from human rights abuses. These are particularly child labor, and punitive amputations for villagers who mine in surrounding areas and ‘steal’ company property. For many mine workers, COVID-19 also worsened conditions and exploitation. Environmentally, lab-created diamonds still use a lot of energy. But they are up to 10 times more efficient than the fossil fuels, explosives, and heavy machinery used in diamond mines. It is much easier to source renewable energy for lab-created diamonds. Pandora’s commitment is that they will use 100 percent renewables by 2022. As with plant-based meat and dairy alternatives, the switch in purchasing power is being driven by young people. They are prioritising sustainability when choosing expensive jewellery.  Perhaps that’s why a lab-grown diamond company has become the first ‘Certified Sustainable’ and ‘Certified Climate Neutral’ diamond producer, with attention also give to water consumption, traceability, and diversity in its workforce production. Mined diamonds can no longer be marketed as ‘natural’ in contrast with lab-created. The jewellery industry now recognises both as ‘real’ diamonds. What is really driving change in consumer habits is cost. Lab-created diamonds are around 30 percent cheaper than mined diamonds. That means more people can purchase them for different reasons. (It’s another reason why price parity in the alternative meat and dairy sector is so important.) That’s perfect for a company such as Pandora, which prides itself on creating affordable accessories for people. Up to 77 percent of people in Europe are aware of lab-grown diamonds. “The roadblock to the success of this category has never been the consumer,” research company MVEye reported in 2020. “It has been the trade.” That is, Big Diamond companies such as DeBeers have always controlled the mines and the industry. Change is a threat to their business model. So for the last 20 years, they have spent a lot of effort labeling lab-grown diamonds as ‘artificial’ and ‘fake’. (Sound familiar?) But the writing is on the wall. DeBeers has launched a lab-grown diamond collection for fashion jewelry. Signet, the largest US jewelry retailer, now also sells lab-ground diamonds alongside traditionally mined diamonds. There are decades of research and practice behind the emergence of lab-created diamonds. The same can be said of the fabrics used to make clothes. Back in 2015, Erin Smith, an artist, grew a wedding dress from mycelium, the thread-like fibers that hold mushrooms together. Now that kind of technology is reaching mass scale, as the answer to environmental and ethical problems in the fashion and textile industries. The UN has reported the fashion industry is responsible for 20 percent of global wastewater, and 10 percent of global carbon emissions. That’s more than all international flights and maritime shipping. Cotton farming uses a quarter of all insecticides. But with production moving to the lab, these ecological issues are vastly reduced—as are the concerns surrounding hazardous working conditions. The Future Tech Lab has helped establish 150 new start-ups and over 350 new lab-grown products and technologies to ‘reshape fashion’s footprint’. For vegans and plant-based fashionistas, one of Future Tech Lab’s companies may hold the key to wearing silk again—this time, lab-grown rather than from silkworms. Fashion innovator Bolt Threads has launched a beauty company, Eighteen B, that uses bioengineered and lab-grown silk protein. It’s a key ingredient for clothes and beauty products, including moisturizers. Bolt Threads are also the company behind an ‘unleather’ called Mylo (marketed as ‘All of the Leather; None of the Animal’) which is already being used by adidas, lululemon, and Stella McCartney. And there are more. MuSkin is created from the caps of mushrooms. Reishi is a fungus-grown leather that debuted at New York Fashion Week. Piñatex is a leather alternative from pineapple leaves. Italian-based VEGEA is making leather from wine! (from its waste grape skins, seeds, and stalks.) And Modern Meadow is using collagen from yeast instead of from animals to make vegan leather. It really is a mushrooming industry (sorry!). And the lab-grown plant-based revolution is not limited to food or fabrics, either. Researchers at MIT in America have grown structures of wood-like plants in their laboratories—’growing a table’ as the future of forestry and construction materials. That’s a long way off yet, but the research is heading that way. And it may end the massive environmental impact of forestry. No, not the stuff you get in a joke shop for Halloween. The lab-grown movement is also active in human blood developments—and that’s good news for people who love animals. As ‘lab-grown’ or ‘lab-created’ becomes more accepted in other areas, the more likely it is that society will welcome lab-grown meat and dairy products. Human blood cells were first made ‘in vitro’ and injected back into the donor during an operation in 2011. In 2017, human blood stem cells were grown in the lab for an NHS trial. The benefit is that, if a sick person’s blood stem cells can be grown, they don’t need to look for a match through bone marrow donation. It could save thousands of lives a year. Bristol-based researchers in the UK have used CRISPR gene-editing technology working with the NHS to get closer to the ultimate goal of producing ‘lab-grown red blood cells’ especially for patients with rare blood requirements. There ethical questions here around the ideal of ‘naturalness’. Gene-editing technology has been questioned for its potential uses in making animals in agriculture more pliant and pain-free. Yet these developments in science are pushing further the boundaries of how lab-created or lab-grown products can reduce pain and suffering for humans. Why not for animals, too, if it means removing animals from intensive agriculture? Lab-grown technologies also have the potential to achieve the 3Rs, the holy grail of medical research campaigning: improving human health at the same time as reducing or ending animal models of experimentation and vivisection. For example, researchers at the University of Sheffield have developed a technology using lab-grown mini-scaffolding capable of growing human tissue and bone. It could revolutionise testing by producing ‘bone on a chip’ resources, and so reduce the need for testing on animals—perhaps, we hope, altogether. This technology is already underway in commercial applications. In the US, this is led by Altis (creating lab-grown guts!) and in Germany by bi/ond (for organoid medical testing).  Again, this could change the world, not least with lab-grown organs bringing an end to the transplant crisis—and sparing pigs from ‘donating’ their hearts to humans, too. But of course, where the biggest news has been in the past decade is around lab-grown alternatives to animal products. Organizations such as the Good Food Institute are leading the way in investing in companies who create meat from plants and cultivating meat from cells. Perhaps the biggest development in the last 12 months was the news of the first lab-grown meat to go on sale in Singapore last December. The ‘chicken bites’, produced by the US company Eat Just, passed a safety review by the Singapore Food Agency. And just this week, Nestlé announced that it is exploring emerging technologies for cultured meat. The food giant reported that it is working with several external partners and start-ups, including Future Meat Technologies Ltd, ‘to explore the potential of cultured-meat components that do not compromise on taste or sustainability’. Over time, it could change everything for animals. Daily, around 130 million chickens are slaughtered for their meat. It’s been estimated that lab-grown meat and dairy could see the end of animal-derived food sectors, such as the American ‘beef’ industry, by 2030. This will be driven largely by cost. According to the group Rethink X: “The cost of proteins will be five times cheaper by 2030 and 10 times cheaper by 2035 than existing animal proteins, before ultimately approaching the cost of sugar.” And it’s not only cost. Lab-grown products will be “superior in every key attribute—more nutritious, healthier, better tasting, and more convenient, with almost unimaginable variety. By 2030, modern food products will be higher quality and cost less than half as much to produce as the animal-derived products they replace.” There’s a lot to learn—and be hopeful for—in the lessons from these other industries. Let’s go back to what the CEO of Pandora Alexander Lacik told Forbes. He’s talking about diamonds, but he could easily be talking about lab-grown meat. “Diamonds have been a business that have been purely mined for centuries,” said Lacik. “Then all of a sudden, there’s an alternative. It constitutes a threat and people start dressing up arguments to deal with the threat. But it’s safe to say that lab-created diamonds are here to stay.” Lab-grown meat and dairy are here to stay, too. It may just see the end of animal agriculture, like mined diamonds, forever. "
30,"Cultured Foie Gras Gets Government Backing, Expected To Meet Price Parity",https://plantbasednews.org/culture/cultured-foie-gras-goverment-backing-price-parity/,2021-07-14,"Foie Gras made with cell-cultured technology has received funding backing from the French government and European Commission. It’s in line with shifting perspectives in the growing industry. And, as companies continue to race to provide an environmentally friendly alternative to meat. A cultivated meat start-up from Paris is ‘reimagining meat for an uncompromising and conscious generation’. This comes despite France being the creator and a major exporter of foie gras, which often involves brutal force-feeding. Whilst it’s traditionally been part of French culture, it’s also been labeled as having ‘existential crisis’ due to the ethical implications. The company, Gourmey, aims to ‘unleash’ the potential of foie gras minus the ‘controversy’ and spoke about its slaughter-free products in a major interview. Co-founder Nicolas Morin-Forest told Bloomberg: “The ambition is that in many places cultivated foie gras not only will be the best option, but it will be the only option.” Moreover, it has already received funding support from the European Commission and Bpifrance, France’s public investment bank. Whilst some higher-end foie gras can reach $176 per kilogram, Morin-Forest is confident Gourmey can significantly decrease its production costs. Currently, plant-based meat alternatives are often considerably more expensive than meat.  This meat price parity is expected to shift, however. Moreover, it’s expected to become one of the quickest changes in the food system. According to Bloomberg, cultured foie gras may be able to reach price parity faster than how it’s conventionally made because it is considered a premium product. There may certainly be a market for cultured foie gras, with UK politicians urging an import ban on the real thing. Earlier this year, various political figures called for the end to the ‘unbearably barbaric’ produced product. It’s already illegal in the UK. But that doesn’t stop around 200 tonnes of it from being imported every year. Moreover, production is banned in other European countries including Denmark, Italy, Poland, and Germany.

37,"BREAKING: Nestlé Plans Cell-Cultured Meat Market Debut, Insiders Reveal",https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/food/nestle-cell-cultures-meat-market-debut/,2021-07-13,"Swiss conglomerate Nestlé is set to expand into the cell-cultured meat market, according to inside sources. The food giant is reportedly teaming up with Israeli start-up Future Meat Technologies Ltd. to bring the alternative protein to the masses. Insiders claim Nestlé plans to blend cultivated meat with plant-based ingredients. Whilst the company has not revealed any details, it comes as Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider looks to meet consumer demands as more report concerns about their health and the environment. This is according to a Bloomberg report. Moreover, it is understood the products will be made under Nestlé’s Garden Gourment brand. The technology firm Future Meat Technologies Ltd. opened the world’s first industrial cultured meat production facility last month. Based in Rehovot, the factory is capable of producing 500kg of product a day: the equivalent of 5,000 burgers. Additionally, the process involves placing animal cells in a bioreactor. Future Meat Technologies Ltd.’s founder Yaakov Nahmias said: “After demonstrating that cultured meat can reach cost parity faster than the market anticipated, this production facility is the real game-changer.” Current plans are to release products in the US by 2022. The concept is to recreate the texture and taste of animal products without killing them. Moreover, it is praised for offering a meat alternative that is better for the environment. Additionally, it’s been billed to one-day end animal agriculture for good. Whilst some experts predict the cell-cultured meat market to grow exponentially over the next few years, it is not with criticism. It’s a topic that has become controversial, with many vegans against it. Equally, many vegans also disagree with Nestlé on ethical grounds. Idk about other vegans but I’m personally against it because it’s cells that come from the animals and the definition of veganism not to (or restrict to the best of your ability) animal product or byproduct. When PBN invited readers to offer their views, a host reported concerns over how animals will be kept before cells are taken. Despite this, others were in favor of it with hopes it could stamp out factory farming. ‘It’s the messing around with nature that bothers me. Every time we do something untoward happens. I’d rather not eat it anyway but it may persuade others to become vegan’, one respondent claimed. However, the industry is expected to be worth a staggering $352 million by 2028. And, it could reach grocery stores within the next five years. PBN has approached Nestlé for comment "
40,"Plant-Based Meat Market Secures Over $1 Billion Revenue Over COVID-19 Pandemic, Report Claims",https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/food/plant-based-meat-market-bags-billion-revenue/,2021-12-07,"The global plant-based meat market bagged soaring revenue of more than $1 billion over 2020, according to new research. This occurred in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is a driving factor in the industry’s success, researchers claim. And, as a result of this, demand soared and plant-based meat alternatives welcomed vast investment. Moreover, the new data outlines industry predictions for the coming decade. Over 2020, the alternative protein industry celebrated big wins. During the pandemic, more people became concerned about meat consumption. And, the meat market supply chain saw huge disruptions. This all led to a growing global hunger for plant-based products. Moreover, the industry has seen ‘burgeoning’ demand, according to P&S Intelligence. The market research firm collected data by analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on vegan meat substitutes. This includes soy, wheat, and pea proteins, including tofu, tempeh, seitan, and Quorn. Combined, the industry bagged revenue of $1.769 billion last year alone, the report states. Moreover, soy-based products are predicted to hold the largest share in the market over the next ten years. However, seitan is set to hold the highest growth rate. Of all the different regions across the world, it is Asia-Pacific that’s expected to see the fastest growth in the sector. This is partially due to the surging population, according to the report. With North America being the largest market for plant-based meat products, it is also predicted to generate the most money. This is due to ‘growing public preference’ the researchers claim. Moreover, the report states: “The rising concerns regarding food security and sustainability and rising investments in plant-based protein sources are the key driving factors for the meat substitutes market.” "
47,Aleph Farms To Launch Cell-Based Steak Following $105M Fundraising Round,https://plantbasednews.org/news/science/aleph-farms-cell-based-steak-fundraising/,2021-10-07,"Cultured meat startup Aleph Farms just closed a $105 million Series B funding round. The company says it will use the funds to launch its cell-based steak next year. Aleph Farms is based in Israel, but is planning large scale global commercialization of its beef steaks. The funding round was led by Disrupt AD and Growth Fund of L Catterton. The latter is the largest global consumer-focused private equity firm, while DisruptAD is one of the largest venture platforms in the Middle East. Multi-national beef supplier Cargill, who is an existing investor, also participated. Aleph Farms has now raised more than $118 million. Co-founded in 2017, the company’s short-term goals include scaling-up manufacturing and expanding operations internationally. It also plans to expand its product lines and technology platform prior to its initial market launch in 2022.

Didier Toubia is the Co-Founder and CEO of Aleph Farms. He commented that the capital will bring the company ‘significantly closer to our vision of providing secure and unconditional access to high-quality nutrition to anyone, anytime, anywhere’. He added: “We see our investors as partners for building this new category of meat and it was critical to us that they share our strong commitment to improving the sustainability of our global food systems.” Cultured meat – also called lab-grown meat or clean meat – is produced by in vitro cell cultures of animal cells. Scientists harvest muscle cells from a living animal, which can be done without harming them. They then nurture the cells with sugar and salts. This helps the cells function as if they were still inside the animal, so that they multiply and create muscle tissue. Cultured meat is biologically identical to traditional meat, but may sidestep some health risks linked to animal meat. For instance, researchers say lab-grown meat is less likely to be infected by contaminants like E. coli bacteria. Further, scientists can make the meat without antibiotics, and can alter the product to have less fat and cholesterol. "

93,World’s First Cultured Meat-Production Facility Opens In Israel,https://plantbasednews.org/news/science/worlds-first-cultured-meat-production-facility-opens-in-israel-future-meat-technologies/,2021-06-25,"Israeli startup Future Meat Technologies has opened the world’s first industrial cultured meat facility.  The production facility, based in the city of Rehovot, is capable of producing 500kg of cultured meat a day. That’s the equivalent of 5,000 hamburgers.  The startup is using bioreactors to culture meat, including ham, chicken and lamb, as well as beef in the future.  Future Meat Technologies’ CEO, Rom Kshuk, said: “This facility opening marks a huge step in Future Meat Technologies’ path to market, serving as a critical enabler to bring our products to shelves by 2022. “Having a running industrial line accelerates key processes such as regulation and product development.” The company’s process involves taking proprietary animal cells and placing them in a bioreactor, where the cells continuously grow. This usually requires the usage of animal serum but the Israeli startup is using methods that do not require material from animals.  Future Meat Technologies also uses a ‘media rejuvenation process’ that removes cellular waste more efficiently. The company say this has yielded 10 times more product than industry standards and has reduced production cost.  It also says its process uses 99 percent less land, generates 80 percent less greenhouse gas emissions, and uses 96 percent less freshwater than typical meat production. The cultured meat industry is booming  and is expected to reach $352.4 million by 2028. Last year, the first cultured meat became available to buy for the first time in a restaurant in Singapore.  However, the costs of production are high; the first lab-grown burger cost $330,000 to produce in 2013.  But companies are quickly cutting these production costs down and Future Meat Technologies is producing price parity faster than market predictions. At $4 per 100 grams, the company says this is the lowest price yet for a cultured chicken breast. It predicts the cost will drop even further in the next 12-18 months. The company’s founder and chief scientific officer, Yaakov Nahmias, said:  “After demonstrating that cultured meat can reach cost parity faster than the market anticipated, this production facility is the real game-changer. “Our goal is to make cultured meat affordable for everyone, while ensuring we produce delicious food that is both healthy and sustainable, helping to secure the future of coming generations.” Future Meat Technologies is currently aiming for its products to reach markets in the US by 2022 and is currently exploring several US locations for expansion.

David MacLennan, who’s worked at the company since 1991, reportedly made the comment at a National Grain and Feed Association convention. According to Reuters, he said: “Our analysis is that in three to four years plant-based will be perhaps 10 percent of the market.  “We’re a large beef producer and that is a big part of our portfolio. So there’s some cannibalization that will occur.” Moreover, the brand is reportedly working on developing a new alternative protein made from corn. “We’re not only thinking about North American launches, but across the globe,” Cargill said, according to Food Navigator. “Corn protein is a great protein for meat alternatives because it’s got a great neutral flavor profile and really good performance.” Back in 2018, Cargill invested in pea protein brand PURIS to ‘accelerate a new wave of sustainable plant-based foods’. David Henstrom is the Vice President of Cargill Starches, Sweeteners and Texturizers. He said: “PURIS is a game-changer in terms of taste and vertical integration in pea protein. “Cargill is excited to expand into the emerging pea protein space while continuing to support our conventional agricultural crops. “It’s clear that PURIS is in alignment with Cargill’s vision to meet the growing demand for protein globally and to help customers deliver label-friendly products without sacrificing taste.” Since then, the meat giant partnered with KFC China to trial vegan chicken in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.

230,Khaled bin Alwaleed Secures First-Ever Investment In France’s Vegan Ecosystem,https://plantbasednews.org/news/economics/prince-khaled-secures-investment-in-frances-vegan-ecosystem/,2021-05-26,"KBW Ventures, founded by Chief Executive Officer Khaled bin Alwaleed, has announced its first-ever investment in France’s vegan ecosystem.  The venture company has invested in Furahaa Group – which was founded in 2015 by Arthur Devillers.  It operates three subsidiaries: Plant B2B, ViVeg, and its eponymous dining venue Furahaa. Plant B2B is a supply chain and distribution entity; ViVeg is a vegan food subscription box business, and Furahaa is a ‘highly-rated’ vegan fast-food chain.  In a statement sent to PBN, Khaled said: “This is my first investment in the French market.  “Furahaa Group, driven by Arthur’s vision for an inclusive and diverse workplace, while giving both consumers and other vendors a route to choose plant-based options, had me interested in the business immediately. “The distribution business is strong, and during the pandemic, I saw a swift and organized pivot– something any investor would find very attractive in a portfolio company.” Devillers added: “Furahaa Group was initially seeking like-minded investors to ensure our stock stability.  “We wanted to better meet shortages of plant-based food, as in France alternative proteins – meat and dairy alternatives – are not yet widely available at competitive price points. “Sourcing quality ingredients at price parity was a challenge, so this led to Furahaa Group developing our own supply chain and distribution streams.” Moreover, the Group aims to expand in France with the launch of several new outlets.  “Furahaa would like to be the first plant-based chain in France,” added Devillers.  “It’s simple. We want to be everywhere that mainstream fast food is, but offering plant-based alternatives.” "

Terviva will use oil found in Pongamia trees for its plant-based protein products. It hopes to roll out commercial quantities by 2023, according to Food Navigator. The company utilizes Pongamia trees, which are part of the pea family, and produces a golden ‘buttery’ oil. Additionally, it is ‘highly soluable’ with a neutral taste, the news outlet adds. Terviva began researching the trees because they offer a similar protein yield to soybeans, leading to the nickname ‘vertical soy’. However, the company says it’s committed to ensuring the trees don’t lose nutrients during harvest. This is to ensure a scalable and sustainable future. Moreover, it is planting crops in locations in Florida, Hawaii, and Australia. In its latest investment round, led by Astera Institute, Terviva raised $54 million. The company’s CEO announced the news, along with confirmation the company will work with Danone to develop new products using oil from the Pongamia trees. Merijin Dols is Global Director of Open Innovation at Danone. Dols told the news organization: “We believe that healthy foods need a healthy planet with thriving ecosystems and strong, resilient social structures. “This is why we are excited to team up with Terviva to co-develop important ingredients – edible protein and oil – from the Pongamia tree. While also rehabilitating the soil the tree grows in.” You can find out more about Danone here Moreover, you can see more of Terviva’s work here "

Because, Animals says it is the first biotech company to grow cell-cultured meat for dogs and cats.  It recently closed its seed-stage financing round led by Orkla – a leading food giant in Europe – and secured follow-up investment from SOSV, Draper Associates, Keen Growth Capital, and others.  This brought the company’s total financing to a staggering $6.7 million to date.  Because, Animals says the investment will help scale up production, and accelerate the development of its first commercial cell-cultured meat pet product: a cat treat. The brand is also developing a ‘nutritionally complete’ plant and cell-cultured-based dog food to add to its current offerings.  Moreover, it aims to have its cell-cultured pet products on the market in 2022, pending regulatory approval.  Shannon Falconer, PhD. is the CEO of Because, Animals. In a statement sent to PBN, she said: “Partnering with a major international food player like Orkla is exactly what we sought to do from the beginning. “We were not interested in just any corporate food heavyweight, we needed them to be firm believers in sustainability and the future of food, and we’ve found exactly that combination in Orkla.” “Because, Animals’ products and technology are truly differentiated, and stand out as a sustainable, healthy, humane way to feed pets.” Moreover, Elin Tveito Lidman was recently appointed the CEO of Orkla Alternative Proteins. She added: “As a company deeply committed to health and sustainability, we see cultured meat as having interesting potential in terms of sustainability, animal welfare, and food safety.  “Because, Animals’ products and technology are truly differentiated, and stand out as a sustainable, healthy, humane way to feed pets.” Lidman then concluded: “Its progress in developing cell lines, growth media, and driving down cost is impressive… All vital steps in bringing cultured meat technology to market.” "
260,Meat Boss Says Interest In Vegan Alternatives Will Fall – Despite Booming Market Predictions,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/food/meat-boss-says-interest-in-vegan-alternatives-will-fall/,2021-05-20,"A meat boss has said interest in vegan alternatives will fall, despite booming predictions for the plant-based meat market. Sergey Yushin is the Chairman of the Russian National Meat Association. According to reports, he dubbed meat-free substitutes as a ‘wave-like trend’ due to their ‘novelty and fashion’. Yushin then insisted people who try plant-based meats will later return to animal products. “There are far more people looking to increase their meat consumption than there are who want to eat substitute,” he added. However, market researchers predict the plant-based food market to grow at a CAGR of 11.9 percent from 2020 for the next years. A report conducted by Meticulous Research says the global market will be worth more than $74 billion by 2027. Drivers for the increase include an ‘increased’ vegan population, ‘significant investments in plant-based product companies, and ‘increasing incidences of intolerance for animal protein’. “[COVID-19] has led to some best practice models for plant-based products industry as the pandemic has conveyed to the forefront the connection between public health and animal meat consumption, which provides consumers a ground to go for a plant-based diet,” the report states. “From a manufacturing and distributing point of view… This industry has faced unprecedented demand from manufacturers as well as consumers, particularly for some products such as meat analog and plant-based milk. “Many companies in the space of alternative protein products have already started changing their strategies, owing to the sudden growth in demand.” "
263,Eat Just Bags $170 Million Investment And Partners Luxury Hotel To Scale Cultivated Meat,https://plantbasednews.org/news/science/eat-just-bags-170-million-and-partners-luxury-hotel-to-scale-cultured-meat/,2021-05-19,"Eat Just has secured a $170 million investment and partnered with the luxury hotel, JW Marriott Singapore South Beach, in order to scale up its cultivated meat division. The plant-based food tech brand will use the funds to boost the production of the meat alternatives. And, it hopes to install facilities in the US and Asia, according to Food Ingredients First. CEO and Co-Founder Josh Tetrick told the news outlet: “This investment, along with the historic decision by JW Marriott Singapore South Beach, points to what’s ahead.  “Meat without killing animals will replace conventional meat at some point in our lifetimes. The faster we make that happen, the healthier our planet will be.” A Chinese restaurant within the luxury hotel, Madame Fan, is set to be one of the first restaurants worldwide to serve cell-cultured chicken, courtesy of Eat Just. “Continued investment is critical to ensure that cultivated meat can meet the moment.” In a statement sent to PBN, food expert Bruce Friedrich welcomed the news. However, he said it’s important to keep perspective. The cultivated meat market share will remain ‘just a fraction’ of the ‘conventional’ meat market, he said. And that’s unless governments start injecting funds into basic research and development. Additionally, they must ‘incentivize’ among the private sector, in order to enable the industry to scale up. “Continued investment is critical to ensure that cultivated meat can meet the moment – providing a more sustainable, safe, and secure way of feeding people with far fewer greenhouse gas emissions. “And, far less land and water required, and no contribution to antibiotic resistance and pandemic risk.” Friedrich is also the Executive Director of The Good Food Institute (GFI), a global non-profit food organization. GFI’s Acting Manager Director, Mirte Gosker agreed further support is needed to propel the cultivated meat market. ‘Now the responsibility rests with global leaders to bring this better way of making meat to the masses. ‘For the entire industry, investments and commitments like this continue to signal that this technology is here today rather than some far-off future endeavor’, she said. However, Gosker predicts the meat alternative will soon boom: “Fully electric cars will someday simply be referred to as cars. “Cultivated meat can become the default if the industry receives adequate public and private funding to scale up.” "

Ivy Farm Technologies plans to remove the equivalent of 170,000 pigs from the production line by producing over 12,000 tonnes of pork. The process works by taking a small number of cells from a pig and placing them in a bioreactor. Once vitamins and nutrients are added, it is ready for harvest. This takes around three to four weeks. Since developing the system, Ivy Farm is raising £16 million in order to build a pilot research and development production facility near the university. It will mark the first step in the plan to become global industry leaders. Moreover, the company says the ‘scaffold system’ it developed means it can produce cells more quickly and cheaply than any other technology currently available across the world. It hopes to roll out slaughter-free sausages in supermarkets and restaurants by 2023. Co-founder Russ Tucker is eyeing putting the UK on the map in the cell-cultured meat sector. In a statement sent to PBN, he said: “If you look at the world around us, the way we currently produce and consume food is unsustainable.  “Cultured meat is the silver bullet – through cutting-edge technology, we can provide real, high-quality meat while saving the planet.” “Already nearly half the worldwide harvest is required to feed livestock and that’s only going to go up. “Cultured meat is the silver bullet – through cutting-edge technology, we can provide real, high-quality meat while saving the planet. “Ivy Farm will be great for the environment, great for meat lovers, and great for animals as there’s no slaughter.” People are becoming more interested in trying cell-cultured meat. According to Ivy Farm, more than 50 percent are willing to buy it. It comes after the predictions claim a staggering 60 percent of all meat consumed in 2040 will not come from dead animals. Rich Dillon, Ivy Farm Chief Executive, said: “Make no mistake, cultured meat is here to stay. It’s a compelling proposition – real meat, guilt-free. “We believe our technology is among the best in the world and that we can fly the flag for Britain.” Currently, the company is in talks with the Food Standards Agency. They will have to authorize the products before they can be sold.  "

The company announced earlier this week it is expanding its plant-based line Raised & Rooted to meet the increased demand for alternative proteins. New additions to the brand include the first-ever vegan burger patties, as well as Bratwurst and Italian sausages, and ground beef. The new products, priced competitively between $4.99 and $7.99, are available in the refrigerated section of grocery stores nationally. “We’re excited to provide people with satisfying alternative protein options perfect for any occasion.” Moreover, David Ervin is the vice president of marketing of Raised & Rooted.

Dr. Simon Somogyi is the director of Longo’s Food Retail Laboratory and Arrell Chair in the business of food at the University of Guelph. In an interview with Sudbury, he said: “When it comes to cellular-based meat, it’s very basic meat that we’re talking about. Something that would compete with ground beef for example. “At this point in time… It’s not possible to make a steak that has a bone attached to it, because that’s a little more complicated. And, the texture of steak is different from ground beef which is very much minced stuff.” He added that advancements in technology mean other cell-cultured seafood could become available in retailers in the next decade.  Dr. Somogyi then concluded: “The issue they face is that for that product to be workable in the marketplace, it has to be produced at a certain cost of production, that’s competitive for the marketplace for the substitute which is animal meat.” Moreover, researchers have predicted a staggering 60 percent of the meat consumed in 2040 will not come from dead animals. The report was published by global consultancy AT Kearney. It says 35 percent of meat will be cell-cultured and 25 percent will be vegan alternatives. These predictions were based on interviews with experts, who cited environmental impact and animal welfare concerns as reasons behind the growing interest in alternative protein.  “The large-scale livestock industry is viewed by many as an unnecessary evil,” the report says.  “With the advantages of novel vegan meat replacements and cultured meat over conventionally produced meat… It’s only a matter of time before they capture a substantial market share.” "

It is hoped the billionaire businessman’s Horizon Ventures firm will see further development in the plant-based protein industry. Currently, getting the fats right in plant-based meat alternatives is difficult, a Horizon Ventures investor told Forbes. It is ‘an impossible task’, littered with ‘complexities’. The investment firm has already helped provide checks for plant-based protein giants Impossible Foods and Eat Just. Nourish Ingredients was formed to find the solution and to ensure that it is a sustainable and minimally-processed one. Despite it being in its prototype phase, ‘dozens’ of companies have already requested samples. The $11 million funds injection will be used for further lipid testing. ‘Our specialty fats and oils make plant-based alternative proteins taste just as good as the original but animal-free. We can tailor flavor and mouthfeel to precisely reproduce the taste and texture of pork, beef, chicken, fish, milk, cheese, and beyond’, co-founders Dr. James Petrie and Dr. Ben Leita claim. The pair met whilst researching lipids in 2013. Since then, they developed a fermentation process aiming to recreate the structure of animal fats. Whilst a lot of companies are focussing on proteins, Nourish Ingredients claims it is fats that are ‘essential’ in making them taste like the real thing. It is exciting to be part of a ‘revolutionary’ industry, the start-up added. You can find out more about Nourish Ingredients here  "

521,Europe And US To Hit ‘Peak Meat’ By 2025 – Causing Animal Protein Consumption To Start Declining,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/europe-and-north-america-to-hit-peak-meat-by-2025/,2021-03-24,"Europe and North America will hit ‘peak meat’ by the year 2025 – meaning the consumption of animal protein will begin to decline. A new report predicts the market for alternative proteins will grow to 97 million metric tons by 2035 – making up 11 percent of the overall protein market  Food for Thought: The Protein Transformation says faster technological innovation and full regulatory support could boost growth to 22 percent of the market by 2035. At the latter’s rate, Europe and North America would reach ‘peak meat’ by 2025. Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Blue Horizon Corporation (BHC) conducted the research.  BCG managing director Benjamin Morac said: “Alternative proteins could soon match animal protein in taste, texture, and price.  “We expect parity to spur a new wave of growth, catapulting what is a fairly nascent market today into the mainstream, yielding significant environmental benefits, and facilitating even faster growth.”  The report describes price parity as the ‘key to consumer acceptance’ when it comes to alternative proteins.  It predicts plant-based alternatives such as burgers made from soy, pea, and other proteins will achieve parity in 2023, if not sooner.  Moreover, alternative proteins made from microorganisms like fungi, yeasts, and single-celled algae will reach parity by 2025. And, alternatives grown directly from animal cells will reach parity by 2032. BHC managing partner and CEO, Björn Witte, added: “The alternative protein arena is wide open, and progress is happening fast.  “There’s a real opportunity here for investors to make their moves early. And, become integral players in the future of food.  “But, to successfully navigate the industry… They must hone their technical knowledge, ensuring they’re one step ahead of potential disruptions.” You can view the full report here "
543,"Cell-Cultured Meat Could Be Part Of Climate Solution, Says BBC",https://plantbasednews.org/news/environment/cell-cultured-meat-part-of-climate-solution-says-bbc/,2021-03-19,"Cell-cultured meat could be part of the solution to tackle climate change, according to the BBC.  The broadcaster explores advancements in cellular agriculture over recent years in a news video, and asks experts whether it could help ‘reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the future’. Whilst cell-cultured meat is slaughter-free, it is not by definition vegan as it currently uses cells from animals. Some scientists also use a bovine growth serum – though companies are working on making the tech animal-free.  However, some vegans support clean meat because of its potential to dramatically reduce the number of animals slaughtered. Last year, Singapore became the first country to approve of cell-cultured chicken created by Eat Just.  Under the company’s Good Meat brand, the slaughter-free meat was then served to an inaugural table of customers – which included ‘a group of inspiring young people committed to building a better planet’.  One 12-year-old guest said: “This chicken, it’s just chicken… But it’s the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen or ever tasted.” However, the BBC says: “It’s not just the taste that’s got people excited. It’s also the potential positive impact on the environment… “A quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food. Most of those emissions are from meat and dairy, and that’s set to rise as global meat demand increases… On top of that, the meat industry also contributes to large-scale deforestation…” Dr. Alexandra Sexton is a food security and responsible innovation expert from the University of Sheffield.  She said: “If lab meat can reduce the amount of land needed to make meat, then this could be a significant benefit in helping to tackle climate change. But, it does also depends on what that freed-up land is used for.” Dr. Sexton added that because the technologies used in cellular agriculture are ‘relatively new’ – there is no way of knowing what the environmental impact will be when produced en masse.  However, a new study says cell-cultured meat compared with conventional beef, can slash global warming impacts by up to 92 percent. Researchers from CE Delft also found cell-based meat could cause 93 percent less air pollution and use up to 95 percent less land and 78 percent less water.  The studies model a future large-scale cultivated meat production facility. It shows that by 2030, the cost of cell-based meat, when manufactured at scale, could drop to $5.66 per kg. "
544,Vegan Meat Price Parity: Why Cost Not Kindness Will End Animal Agriculture,https://plantbasednews.org/opinion/opinion-piece/vegan-meat-price-parity/,2021-03-18,"It will be cost not kindness that ends animal agriculture – but when will we achieve vegan meat price parity? As much as we care for animals, it’s likely that ‘price parity’ between plant-based and animal-derived meats will see the quickest changes made to our food system We love cheap food. When asked, we nearly always say we prefer to buy products that are ethical, sustainable, and healthy. But research shows time and again that what actually drives most of our food choices are cost, convenience, and taste. Most of all, it’s the price.  That’s why the question of ‘price parity’ is a hot topic in plant-based food. With price, especially a cheap price, such a driving force in our food choices, the cost of plant-based meats really matters. Right now, supermarket customers are paying almost 200 percent more for plant-based products in comparison to meat alternatives.  It’s also why the European dairy lobby is trying to stop plant-based products being sold in ‘dairy’ packaging. If plant-based providers have to use different packaging, this could make plant-based alternatives more difficult to produce and, critically, more expensive to buy. But lessons from other industries (such as electric cars) show that as technology develops and demand increases, price parity will arrive. But for plant-based meat products, when will that be? Can it really bring an end to the slaughter-based meat products that are currently cheaper and purchased more often? We love cheap food. As the UK government’s Behavioral Insights Team wrote in their report ‘A Menu For Change’, price (alongside convenience and taste) is the most important factor for people when shopping. This includes for healthier alternatives. This isn’t our fault. Supermarkets, advertising, and government policies have spent 70 years creating what food expert Professor Tim Lang calls our ‘cheap food paradigm’.  This is especially in the UK and US. Along with Singapore, these are the three cheapest food markets in the world. In the UK, we spend only 8 percent of our household budget on food. This is the cheapest in Western Europe. Greeks spend 16 percent, Peruvians 26 percent, and Nigerians 59 percent. But when you learn that the UK also has the highest food poverty in Europe in terms of people being able to afford a healthy diet, you know something is wrong. This cheap food paradigm emerged during World War 2. Farmers were asked to grow more food, quickly and cheaply. They were the heroes feeding a country at war, and rebuilding afterward.  Farmers were doing what they were asked. They began using heavy chemicals and pesticides. They abandoned rotation farming and replaced them with monocultures. Food got increasingly cheap. There were supermarket price wars (continuing today). We lost touch with the true cost of food. The true cost of cheap food is a ‘spiraling public health crisis and environmental destruction’ – according to the RSA’s Food, Farming and Countryside Commission.  Last month’s Chatham House/UN report drove home the point: “Cheap food is driving destruction of the natural world.” The constant demand for economic growth has ‘sustained vicious circles’ of agricultural efficiency, coupled with ‘increased economic competition through the liberalization of trade’. Cheap foods also tend to be more processed. In the UK, we eat the most ultra-processed foods in Europe, nearly 50 percent of our diets. Compare this to around 11 percent in Italy or 16 percent in Portugal. This massively increases the incidence of Type-2 diabetes and other serious health epidemics. It’s obvious we need a food transformation. And that includes the price we pay for it.  What we should do is ask those who can afford more to pay more, while supporting those currently in food poverty to be able to buy better. But that’s another article! We also know that a whole-foods plant-based diet can be much cheaper than a heavily processed, animal-based diet. Right now, most meat-eaters overestimate the price of plant-based meat products. And they’re not wholly wrong.  So if we want to see change happen quickly, we have to get people off the slaughter-based meats and into the plant-based aisles. The quickest way to do that is through pricing. So when will that happen? It will arrive in three stages. Back in 2019, the independent think tank Rethink X launched its report on the future of agriculture.  Their analysis suggested that price parity between existing plant-based meats (for example, the Impossible Burger) and animal-derived meats would arrive sometime between 2021-23.  When this happened, they wrote, adoption of more plant-based eating “will tip and accelerate exponentially.” It is why companies such as Impossible Foods keep slashing their prices to drive demand, knowing that ‘price parity’ will increase not only sales but awareness and acceptability.  At the moment, buying a vegan supermarket product twice a week would cost an additional £35 a year, a spokesperson for Insure4Sport, who produced research on cost comparisons, told The Times. Right now, the early-adopter vegan and vegetarian or adventurous meat-eater will pay the premium price for the new plant-based alternatives. That won’t last. The plant-based producers know they need to compete on price. Demand is growing. In 2019, demand for plant-based meats grew by 18 percent and 11 percent for the plant-based category overall, according to a study from The Good Food Institute. More people than ever now support improved access to plant-based options. New research last week from The Vegan Society showed one in three (32 percent) believe the government should be promoting vegan and plant-based diets to address the current climate emergency. Bill Gates recently urged people to buy plant-based products and drive down the price. “You can also send a signal to the market that people want zero-carbon alternatives and are willing to pay for them,” he told the BBC. The supermarkets will drive this difference. If Tesco’s is setting a target for a 300 percent rise in vegan meat sales, they’ll still want to compete on price. So perhaps Rethink X’s prediction that we will reach price parity for existing products by 2023 isn’t far off. But what about the new world of cell-cultured meat, grown in a lab? Cell-cultured meat is real meat or dairy but without the animal. It is grown or fermented in vats or produced in other ways without needing animals to die.  (There is controversy around this claim: early production used serum from slaughtered calves. But new procedures are being developed without any animal deaths.) Rethink X also predicted there would be 50 percent fewer cows in American agriculture by 2030. It predicted once cows disappeared in America, the rest of the world—and the other animal industries, such as pork and chicken—would follow. The cause? Not ethics, but technology. Or rather, what it calls ‘a protein disruption driven by economics’. In its new ‘cell-cultured’ technologies producing meat and dairy products in labs, would produce ‘proteins five times cheaper by 2030 … than existing animal proteins.” This report was theoretical. Was it simply wishful thinking? Well, two new studies published earlier this month think it is going to happen by 2030. These studies are based on actual data from existing protein producers. This research, from the Good Food Institute, suggests ‘cultivated meat could compete on costs and have a lower environmental footprint compared to conventional meat production in under 10 years’. The figures are astounding. The life cycle assessment and techno-economic assessment suggest when compared with beef from cows, cultivated meat will produce 92 percent less global warming gases and 93 percent less air pollution, using 95 percent less land. If renewable energy is used, then 78 percent less water is needed too.  And the coronavirus has only made animal agriculture more expensive, as well as highlighted its critical role as a breeding ground for zoonotic pandemics. So plant-based burger price parity by 2023. Then cell-cultured burgers by 2030. Rethink X argued that not only will we achieve price parity, but that by 2035 cell-based and plant-based alternatives will be 10 times cheaper than defunct animal-derived products. Motivated by price, they suggest the average family will save more than $1,200 in food costs. But also, these slaughterless proteins will be superior too: “More nutritious, healthier, better tasting, and more convenient, with almost unimaginable variety… modern food products will be higher quality and cost less than half as much to produce as the animal-derived products they replace.” The research commissioned by the Good Food Institute seems to suggest we’re moving in this direction. From an ethical point of view, as plant-based and slaughter-free foods become the norm, people will be free to wonder how we ever used to kill so many animals, at such horrific cost. We’re not there yet. But as individual consumers, buying plant-based alternatives will drive up demand and drive down the cost, meaning regular meat-eaters will pick them up too.  According to YouGov, nearly a quarter of diehard meat-eaters say they enjoy meat-alternatives. If we make it easier for them on price, that figure will only increase. We can work together as citizens to put collective pressure on the government. Not least to take up the recommendations in their own Behavioral Insights Team’s report!  Actions such as incentivizing product innovation, a carbon tax, raising awareness, and creating real value for farmers for their food, will all help reshape our ‘cheap food paradigm’. Then we’ll reach price parity sooner. So keep buying those sausage, burger, and chicken alternatives. Every time you do, you tell the companies there’s a market.  Whether it’s 2023 or 2030, price parity will arrive. Then, plant-based meats will be cheaper. When that happens, with all their inherent costs and environmental impacts, animal-derived and slaughter-based meats won’t be able to compete.  We’re more than consumers of course. But this really is one way we can help shape the future. "

The Good Food Institute (GFI) released the data today, and says it ‘signals a growing appetite for climate-friendly investments’. It found that plant-based meat, egg, and dairy companies received $2.1 billion in investments in 2020. This is the most capital raised in any single year in the industry’s history and more than three times the $667 million raised in 2019.  Cultivated meat companies received more than $360 million* in investments in 2020 – six times the amount raised in 2019. Moreover, fermentation companies ‘devoted to alternative proteins’ received $590 million in investments in 2020. This is more than double the amount raised in 2019.  Sharyn Murray is GFI’s Senior Investor Engagement Specialist. In a statement sent to PBN, she said: “The investor community is waking up to the massive social and economic potential of food technology to radically remake our food system.  “Early trendsetters like Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat, Memphis Meats, and Mosa Meat continue to perform well. And, there are more and more entrepreneurs who see the potential of alternative proteins to succeed in the marketplace while having a positive global impact on food sustainability and global health.” Caroline Bushnell, GFI’s Director of Corporate Engagement, describes 2020 as a ‘breakout year for alternative proteins’. She added: “This is yet another signal of the significant potential the private sector sees in this rapidly growing global industry.  “While the amount is record-breaking, more investment is needed—from both the public and the private sectors—to meet the urgency of this moment. “A large-scale shift toward alternative proteins will be critical to mitigating the environmental impact of food production, meeting the Paris Climate Agreement, and sustainably feeding a growing global population.” *Although animal cell culture has primarily been applied to cultivated meat production to date. This data also includes $13 million in investments in companies using similar processes to produce dairy. "
556,"Meatless Farm To Open Plant-Based Factory In Canada, Hints At Cell-Based Meat Venture",https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/food/meatless-farm-to-open-plant-based-factory-in-canada-hints-at-cell-based-meat-venture/,2021-03-16,"The Meatless Farm Company is opening a plant-based factory in Canada, and may move into the cell-based meat market.  The brand has launched a dedicated plant protein ingredients subsidiary dubbed Lovingly Made Ingredients. It will provide its global supply of textured plant protein and ‘expand into broader external supply operations’. Lovingly Made Ingredients will operate out of a new flagship plant protein facility in Calgary, where it will be the first of its kind on this scale. Moreover, Meatless Farm describes the move as one of its ‘biggest investments to date’. It has invested an initial $12 million in its manufacturing infrastructure with the 30,000 sq ft plant, which will have the capacity to produce up to 14,500 tonnes of plant protein ingredients by 2023.  Morten Toft Bech is the founder of Meatless Farm. In a statement sent to PBN, he said: “Meatless Farm started less than five years ago at my kitchen table. It’s amazing to see us open a facility of this size and scale and is testament to the growth and importance of this sector.  “The pace of global growth presents opportunities for how we can share our expertise and innovation with other partners and that is where Lovingly Made Ingredients comes in.  “Our mission to reduce global meat consumption looks beyond just our brand, we need to do more.  “Consumers are learning how big an impact reducing your meat consumption can have on cutting carbon emissions. And, that even small changes add up to help make a bigger difference. “For example, in the UK, if we all had just one less meat meal per week we could see emissions reduce by around eight percent.  Bech then added: “This is why we are focussing on making products that appeal to meat-eaters, not just vegetarians and vegans. And, we want to support others in that mission too… “Canada is the pea-capital of the world. So, it makes sense to have a facility here which will give us the ability in future to grow, harvest, process and extract our pea protein all within one country.” Following the factory’s announcement, Meatless Farm says it is also thinking about moving into the cell-based meat market.  Moreover, according to The Grocer, Bech described cultured meat as an ‘inevitable part’ of transitioning away from slaughtered meat. He also said it aligned with the company’s aim of ‘reducing animal agriculture’. Then, hinted the company has some ‘interesting products under its umbrella’. However, he concluded: “I don’t have all the answers because there are ethical, regulatory and sustainability issues.” "
584,"Average American Believes US Could Be ‘Entirely’ Meat-Free By 2039, Poll Finds",https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/food/average-american-believes-us-could-be-meat-free/,2021-10-03,"The average American believes the US could be ‘entirely’ meat-free by the year 2039, according to a new poll. The 2,000-person survey was conducted by OnePoll on behalf of Vegan Strong. It found one in three respondents agrees that everyone will be eating meatless foods in the future.  The average year participants think everyone will follow a plant-based diet is 2039. Despite the optimism, a staggering 52 percent of those surveyed said turning plant-based isn’t a ‘realistic possibility’ for them right now. Moreover, one in five said plant-based diets are too expensive and 19 percent think it would be ‘too time-consuming to learn the ins and outs’. Similarly, 55 percent worry they ‘couldn’t survive on a vegan diet’ based on the amount of protein it provides. Robert Cheeke is Vegan Strong’s National Tour Director. In a statement sent to PBN, he said: “Most people don’t realize that plants have all the protein you need.   “Yet many elite athletes are converting to a plant-based diet because they are seeing their performance and strength improve dramatically.” However, 31 percent admitted to having given a vegan recipe a go for the first time during the COVID-19 pandemic.  “Plant-based eating can be incredibly affordable if you focus on eating fruits, vegetables, beans, rice, nuts, and seeds,” Cheeke then added.  “Going vegan is better for your health, your wallet, and the earth.” Moreover, in 2019, a major report predicted 60 percent of meat consumed in 2040 won’t come from dead animals. The report, by global consultancy AT Kearney, says 35 percent of meat will be lab-cultured and 25 percent will be vegan alternatives. The predictions were based on interviews with experts. Environmental impact and animal welfare concerns were cited as reasons behind the growing interest in alternative protein. "
589,"Cultivated Meat Can Slash Global Warming Impacts By 92%, Says New Study",https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/cultivated-meat-slash-global-warming-impacts/,2021-09-03,"Cultivated meat, compared with conventional beef, can slash global warming impacts by up to 92 percent, states a new study. Researchers from CE Delft also found cell-based meat could cause 93 percent less air pollution and use up to 95 percent less land and 78 percent less water.  The studies model a future large-scale cultivated meat production facility. It shows that by 2030, the cost of cell-based meat, when manufactured at scale, could drop to $5.66 per kg. The life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic assessment (TEA) conducted by CE Delft, with support from The Good Food Institute and GAIA, are the first to utilize data from companies active in the cultivated meat supply chain. The LCA analyzes various scenarios. This includes the adoption of renewable energy by both the conventional and cultivated meat industry ‘should they go all-in on their climate mitigation efforts’.  In the most optimistic scenario, which factors in ambitious projections of conventional animal agriculture’s achievements in environmental impact improvements, cultivated meat outperforms all forms of conventional meat. The LCA shows that cultivated meat, when produced using renewable energy, reduces the cumulative environmental impacts of conventional beef by approximately 93 percent, pork by 53 percent, and chicken by 29 percent. In these scenarios, the conventional products are also produced using renewable energy. Moreover, CE Delft says this production cost will enable cultivated meat to ‘compete with multiple forms of conventional meat’. As well as ‘serve as a high-quality ingredient in plant-based meat products’. Ingrid Odegard is CE Delft’s Senior Researcher. In a statement sent to PBN, she said: “We show that cultivated meat presents as an achievable low-carbon, cost-competitive agricultural technology that can play a major role in achieving a carbon-neutral food system.  “This research provides a solid base on which companies can build, improve, and advance in their goal of producing cultivated meat sustainably at scale and at a competitive price point.” “As soon as 2030, we expect to see real progress on costs for cultivated meat.” Elliot Swartz is a Senior Scientist at The Good Food Institute (GFI). He added: “As soon as 2030, we expect to see real progress on costs for cultivated meat. And, massive reductions in emissions and land use brought about by the transition to this method of meat production.  “This research signals a vote of confidence. It serves as a practical roadmap for the industry to address technical and economic bottlenecks, which will further reduce climate impacts and costs.  “Government investment in R&D and infrastructure will be critical to accelerating the development of cultivated meat. And, help us achieve global climate goals.  Swartz then concluded: “Favorable policies and carbon markets can incentivize the restoration of agricultural land for its carbon sequestration and ecosystem services potential. This maximizes the climate benefits of cultivated meat.”  GFI Executive Director Bruce Friedrich also said the world will not achieve net-zero emissions ‘without addressing food and land’. Moreover, he states that alternative proteins are a ‘key aspect of how we do that’.  “Decarbonizing the global economy is impossible with the diffuse production process and range of gases involved in conventional animal agriculture,” Friedrich explained.  “As these new models illustrate… If we can concentrate the environmental impact of meat production in a single, manageable space — and if we power that space with electricity generated from clean energy sources — that’s how the world gets to net-zero emissions.” "
617,Global Food Giant Partners Aleph Farms To Launch Cell-Based Beef In Brazil,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/food/global-food-giant-partners-aleph-farms-launch-cell-based-beef-in-brazil/,2021-04-03,"Global food giant BRF is partnering with Aleph Farms to launch cell-based beef in Brazil. The two companies recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Under this agreement, they will co-develop and produce cultivated meat using Aleph’s ‘patented production platforms’. BRF will also distribute Aleph-backed cultivated beef products in Brazil – currently one of the world’s largest beef exporter. Didier Toubia is the co-founder and CEO of Aleph Farms. In a statement sent to PBN, he said he is ‘thrilled’ to be ‘joining forces’ with BRF. “This new partnership advances Aleph Farms’ strategy to integrate into the existing ecosystem as part of our go-to-market plans,” Toubia added. “Leveraging the expertise and infrastructure of leading food and meat companies will drive a faster scale-up of cultivated meat. And, eventually, lead to a broader positive impact.” He then concluded: “As one of the largest beef producers in the world, Brazil is a strategic market for us. We have been impressed by the strong commitment from BRF management to innovation and sustainability.” “BRF is ready and charged to play a leading role in this food revolution.” Lorival Luz is the CEO of BRF – one of the world’s largest food companies. He also said: “BRF is ready and charged to play a leading role in this food revolution. And, be an active participant in one the greatest industry transformations of this generation. “Since 2014, we have witnessed an increasing global demand for new sources of protein driven by several factors, namely environmental concerns, new diets and lifestyles, which has spurred the growth of new dietary genres such as flexitarianism, vegetarianism and more.” Last year, Aleph Farms met up with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to show off its cell-based steak. The brand’s cultivated steak is grown directly from cow cells under controlled conditions, using ‘a fraction of the resources required for raising an entire animal for meat’ without the use of antibiotics.  Moreover, In a statement sent to PBN, Netanyahu said: “It’s delicious and guilt-free, I can’t taste the difference. “I have directed the State Secretary Tzahi Braverman to appoint a body to serve these industries to connect and oversee all the stakeholders operating in this field.” Netanyahu then concluded: “Israel will become a powerhouse for alternative meat and alternative protein.” Last month, Aleph Farms unveiled what it describes as the world’s first cell-based ribeye steak.  The company and its research partner Israel Institute of Technology cultivated the slaughter-free meat using three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology.  According to Aleph Farms, its cultivated ribeye steak ‘is a thicker cut’ than its flagship product and it ‘incorporates muscle and fat similar to its slaughtered counterpart, boasting the same organoleptic attributes of a delicious tender, juicy ribeye steak you’d buy from the butcher’.

654,What Are the Benefits of Sea Moss? Everything You Need to Know About This Vegan Superfood,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/food/what-are-the-health-benefits-of-sea-moss/,2021-02-25,"Also known as Irish Sea Moss, Carrageen, and Chondrus Crispus – a type of red algae packed with vitamins and minerals – this intriguing superfood is having its moment under the spotlight. Key figures in the nutritional industry, as well as celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, are raving about its health benefits. Sea Moss also has Caribbean roots. Historically, it was used to cure disease and as a form of protection. Now, it is esteemed in the health industry. Often referred to as ‘nature’s multivitamin’, it is packed with iron, magnesium, calcium, potassium, and vitamins A, D, and E.  Additionally, it’s high in protein and has a low caloric index. Plus, it hikes libido, improves metabolism, aids gut health – and the list continues. What can’t this plant-based superfood do for our health? Put simply, Sea Moss is a type of seaweed with many purposes. You can find it along coastlines in Ireland, Europe, and North America. Extracts are used as a plant-based alternative to gelatine. It is packaged and bottled around the globe. More recently, it has become a popular health food with growing interest mushrooming online. A wealth of tablets, gels, soaps, and even honey package Sea Moss as a mood-boosting, disease-busting whole food. Not always used as a health food, it can find its way into products. It is used as a thickener, stabilizer, and emulsifier in skincare products, plant milks, and yogurts. Sea vegetables and seaweed contain a range of fiber and phytonutrients. These nutrients aren’t typically found in soil-grown plants. Research indicates a diet that includes seaweed may help reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases including certain types of cancer. It may also help with endometriosis because it helps break down estrogen, and can help reduce depression, according to the top plant-based medic, Dr. Michael Greger.  Moreover, Greger says consuming seaweed boosts the production of antibodies and T cells which make human immune systems stronger. Immunity in the elderly could be boosted if seaweeds are more widely consumed, Dr. Greger says. In addition, we may also see a reduction in infectious diseases. Another study found people susceptible to developing Parkinson’s could experience neurological benefits from consuming Sea Moss. Different types of Sea Moss helped reduce ‘brain fog’ and increase cognitive function, it found.  Its anti-viral and antioxidant-rich properties have caused people to feel a boost in energy, libido, and better digestion. This is according to Deep Singh, who is the founder of Sea Moss supplier, Sea Moss UK. ‘COVID-19 shifted the perception of health on a global scale’ Sea Moss contains ‘almost every’ mineral the body requires for ‘optimum’ nutritional support, Singh claims – 83 percent of all essential nutrients to be exact. ‘It’s encouraged a boom for Sea Moss as more people open up to functional healing as a way of life. People became more open to taking preventive measures during these unprecedented times. ‘COVID-19 shifted the perception of health on a global scale. ‘We are seeing a rise in not only Sea Moss customers but new competitive Sea Moss brands that are entering the market’, he added. A study published by Nutrition Reviews assessed both the benefits and risks of consuming seaweed, including Sea Moss. Aquaculture account for 96 percent of seaweed production. In order to meet the growing demand’ for seaweed-based ingredients, tighter regulations are needed. This is to ‘ensure’ sustainability, the research states. Seaweed has the power to provide valuable protein for future diets, the authors concluded. ‘It is estimated that 56 million metric tonnes of algae will be required per annum as an alternative protein source by 2054, which will represent 5.94% of global protein demand’, they claim. Protein extracted from seaweed ‘holds promise’ as a source of plant-based protein for humans. Therefore, it could ‘contribute substantially to non-animal protein sources in the future.’ Sea Moss serves as a ‘promising candidate’ in providing an alternative source of fiber, the article continued. This is because it contains agar. Stockers and experts warn of the differences between Carrageen and Carrageenan. Carrageenan is the extract isolated and used in manufacturing, according to Singh. It doesn’t have any ‘nutritional value’ and is used to thicken processed foods. Carrageen refers to the algae, which is rich in nutrients. However, consuming Sea Moss comes with ‘potential’ risks. This is according to nutrition coach and personal trainer, Deanna Hammond-Blackburn. Dr. Greger has equally branded it a potential ‘hazard’. There is only one process of treating carrageen that makes it safe to eat, she said. This is when it’s extracted and processed with alkaline substances, and not acid. Processing it with acid produces poligeenan which is not safe for consumption, she claims. Additionally, the extracted Carrageenan can cause side effects, Hammond-Blackburn added. Symptoms include bloating, allergies, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammation. It contains high levels of iodine. This can cause hypothyroidism, she said. Whilst rare, it is important to note if you have autoimmune thyroid conditions. She says whilst it’s been used medicinally for centuries, it hasn’t been widely researched in ‘academic circles’ yet. For the most part, Sea Moss is cheapest when bought dried. A plethora of recipes call for straightforward preparation. To start, soak the moss until you’ve removed any leftover sand. Next, bring to a boil and simmer for around 10 minutes. Now, strain the water but set it aside. Finally, blitz the moss and add the strained water bit by bit until a gel forms. You can use it to make health-boosting teas when combined with elderflower, lemon, and apple juice, Hammond Blackburn says. This can help fight the common cold. Sea Moss Smoothies are really good too https://t.co/u3Sicbwe4P She said: “There are specific ways to cook carrageen in order to receive the most benefits.” Eating it raw is ‘unpleasant and not recommended’. This is due to its tough texture. “Boiling carrageen in water is the best way to reap its benefits. It releases a flavorless and gelatinous liquid. You can use it in a variety of recipes, usually as a natural way to thicken up soups and stews. Carrageen moss pudding is a popular Irish dish.” Strain through a fine sieve in order to remove leftover carrageen produce, once mixed. Popular methods of consumption include adding it to smoothies, which is how Kim Kardashian uses it. Wash and soak your Sea Moss, before blitzing frozen banana with sweet spices of vanilla, cardamom, nutmeg, and cinnamon for this tasty smoothie recipe. This dessert utilizes ackee, a tropical fruit often used in Caribbean cooking and found in international supermarkets. Warm the fruit with Sea Moss gel, maple syrup, and almond mood. Next, blitz, chill and serve with your chosen toppings. You can create a cozy evening meal with this zesty tapenade recipe. Additionally, add it to pasta or vegetables for a hearty plant-based meal. Whilst Ireland is famed for its Irish cream liqueur, Baileys, this is a healthy plant-based version. The difference is it has Jamaican roots. It involves making a gel from dried Sea Moss and blending it with dates and chosen plant milk. This vegan chili recipe is full of goodness and spice. Simply add your Sea Moss in gel form to tinned plum tomatoes and blitz. "

But, to do so, consumers must reduce their meat and dairy intake by 20 percent, according to a new report by The Climate Change Committee. The Sixth Carbon Budget report, which was published today, describes ruminant meat as the most ‘GHG-intensive source of protein’ and argued that although pigs and poultry produce fewer emissions in comparison – ‘there are concerns that imported animal feed may have high embedded emissions’.  It also praised plant-based protein sources for having ‘significantly fewer GHG emissions than animal-sourced proteins when compared on a like-for-like basis’. Although a reduction of 20 percent falls below Oxford University’s Eatwell Guide, the Climate Change Committee says further reductions post-2030 will be necessary ‘in some scenarios’ and considers how cultured meat may become part of consumers’ diets. Other policies in the report include banning the sale of gas boilers beyond 2033, increase woodland cover from 13 to 15 percent by 2035, and to cut back on travel. “Consuming more of a plant-based diet can reduce non-communicable diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and a range of dietary-related cancers, which in turn can lower the risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19,” the report states. “People with Type 2 diabetes (both controlled and uncontrolled) are 81 percent more likely to die from the virus. NHS England estimates more than 100,000 lives could be saved each year from healthier diets. “Official data indicate that consumption of some meat and dairy products has fallen in the UK. Recent survey data suggests an increased willingness to adopt more of a plant-based diet, while the increased focus on healthier diets due to the impact of COVID-19 may be leading an acceleration in this trend amongst certain groups.” Earlier this year, research from an international team led by the University of Oxford found slashing our use of fossil fuel use is essential to meet global climate targets. But is not enough unless we also transform the global food system. In fact, scientists say, even if fossil fuel emissions stop immediately, emissions from the global food system alone could increase global temperatures by more than 1.5°C. Dr. Michael Clark is from The Oxford Martin School and Nuffield Department of Population Health. In a statement sent to Plant Based News, he said: “Discussions on mitigating climate change typically focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, for instance, from transportation or energy production.  “However, our research emphasizes the importance of reducing emissions from the global food system… The most important is for individuals to shift towards predominantly plant-based diets.” "
1024,French Politician Says ‘Meat Comes From Life Not Labs’ After Cultured Meat Receives Approval,https://plantbasednews.org/culture/politics/french-politician-says-meat-comes-from-life-not-labs/,2020-09-12,"French politician Julien Denormandie has sparked controversy online after declaring ‘meat comes from life, not laboratories’.  The comment follows recent news that Singapore has become the world’s first country to regulatory approve of cultured meat – and will commercially debut cultivated chicken from Eat Just in the near future. Denormandie, who currently serves as France’s Minister of Agriculture, retweeted an article on the groundbreaking news, captioned: “Is this really the society we want for our children?  “[For] me, no. I say it clearly: meat comes from life, not from laboratories. Count on me so that in France, meat remains natural and never artificial!” The tweet was met with controversy, most notably from Agriculture Cellulaire France – an association that aims to ‘inform and fuel reflection round cellular agriculture’. The organization wrote: “It would be a shame to reject from the outset an innovative production method that would allow France to be competitive in the growing field of alternative proteins.  “Instead, let’s promote the development of a French sector that guarantees quality!” Experts say Singapore’s approval of cultured meat will spark a ‘new space race for the future of food’. In a statement sent to Plant Based News GFI Executive Director Bruce Friedrich said: “As nations race to divorce meat production from industrial animal agriculture, countries that delay their investment in this bright food future risk getting left behind.” Friedrich added whichever government manages to rid the need of living animals for meat production will have ‘bragging rights until the end of time’.

1033,Israel’s Prime Minister Describes Cell-Based Steak As ‘Delicious And Guilt-Free’,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/food/israels-prime-minister-says-cell-based-steak-is-delicious/,2020-07-12,"Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described cell-based steak as ‘delicious and guilt-free’.  The politician became the first head of state to taste meat cultivated outside of a cow after visiting Aleph Farms. The brand’s cultivated steak is grown directly from cow cells under controlled conditions, using ‘a fraction of the resources required for raising an entire animal for meat’ without the use of anitbiotics.  In a statement sent to Plant Based News, Netanyahu said: “It’s delicious and guilt-free, I can’t taste the difference. “I have directed the State Secretary Tzahi Braverman to appoint a body to serve these industries in order to connect and oversee all the stakeholders operating in this field. Israel will become a powerhouse for alternative meat and alternative protein.” Isreal is currently facing food security challenges, with 85 percent of the locally consumed beef being imported from other countries.  “The new national plan for alternative proteins involves six different ministries and capitalizes on Israel’s unique capabilities,” says Didier Toubia, Co-Founder and CEO of Aleph Farms. “Aleph Farms is a great example of such collaboration between a governmental agency, the industry, and the academy – all working together to secure a leading position in this key industry.  “The goal of implementing such national programs for food security is to provide unconditional and secure supplies of quality nutrition to anyone, anytime, anywhere. “We feel lucky to be part of the local cultivated meat industry, which is working collaboratively to stimulate a global transition for the protein sector.” Nir Goldstein, Managing Director of The Good Food Institute Isreal (GFI), adds that alternative protein production could prove to be a ‘central economic growth engine’ for the country.  He says the industry if given governmental support, could create an additional 11,000 jobs that would ‘earn the economy billions of dollars each year’.  “The Israeli government has turned the country into a nerve center for plant-based and cultivated meat innovation,” added Bruce Friedrich, Executive Director of GFI.  “Israel is creating a welcoming ecosystem for alternative protein innovation, and the Prime Minister being the first head of state to eat cultivated meat exemplifies this support and underlines the nation’s commitment to the future of meat.” "

The cultured meat is made from harvesting cells, and the company claims the process is similar to growing fruits and vegetables in a greenhouse. Co-founders Dr. Sandhya Sriram and Dr. Ka Yi Ling unveiled the lobster prototype at a private tasting event, using it to make a gazpacho and terrine dish. Dr. Sriram revealed the company’s mission is to transform the seafood industry in order to solve ‘the inefficiencies around global protein production’. Adrien Desbaillets, of Saladstop, who attended the tasting said the taste was ‘wonderful’. He added: “To really get a sense of umami flavors that can be developed from this sort of technology, and by blending it with different bases, it really fascinating. “It’s a great journey that Shiok Meats has been on for the past two years, and exciting to see it all come together.” The meat is ‘animal, health, and environment friendly’ without cruelty, according to Shiok Meats – but cultured meat is not vegan as it still requires the use of animals. Research indicates 35 percent of meat will be lab-cultured over the next 20 years. Shiok Meats plans to launch products in 2022, starting with its Shiok Shrimp. "

The comment comes after Just Eat announced it will sell its cultured chicken to consumers in Singapore. It will make its commercial debut under its GOOD Meat brand. Further details of which have yet to be announced. Elizabeth Derbes is the Associate Director of Regulatory Affairs of The Good Food Institute (GFI).  In a statement sent to PBN, she said: “The Singapore Food Agency has long been in the vanguard of global regulators in its study of cultivated meat…  “Its careful consideration of the best approach for regulating cultivated meat, poultry, and seafood products.  “We’re confident that SFA’s safety standards for these groundbreaking foods [are] carefully calibrated to ensure consumer safety.” Would you be willing to try cultured meat if it involved no animal suffering of any sort? ? Moreover, GFI Executive Director Bruce Friedrich added: “A new space race for the future of food is underway.  “As nations race to divorce meat production from industrial animal agriculture, countries that delay their investment in this bright food future risk getting left behind.” Friedrich also said whichever government manages to rid the need of living animals for meat production will have ‘bragging rights until the end of time’.

1062,Eat Just Receives World’s First Regulatory Approval For Its Cultured Meat,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/food/cultured-meat-recieves-regulatory-approval/,2020-02-12,"Food tech company Eat Just has received regulatory approval for its cultured meat. The company’s slaughter-free chicken will make its commercial debut in Singapore under its GOOD Meat brand. Further details of which have yet to be announced. The approval required an ‘iterative and extensive safety review by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) to entrust Eat Just with ensuring a safe food supply.  During this process, the brand complied with SFA’s food safety requirements for the assessment of novel foods.  Moreover, Eat Just’s cultured chicken received confirmation it is ‘safe and nutritious for human consumption’. This was decided by a distinguished outside panel of international scientific authorities in Singapore and the U.S. Josh Tetrick is the co-founder and CEO of Eat Just. In a statement sent to Plant Based News he said: “Singapore has long been a leader in innovation of all kinds, from information technology to biologics to now leading the world in building a healthier, safer food system.  “I’m sure our regulatory approval for cultured meat will be the first of many in Singapore and around the globe.  “Working in partnership with the broader agriculture sector and forward-thinking policymakers, companies like ours can help meet the increased demand for animal protein as our population climbs to 9.7 billion by 2050.” Lab cultured meat – best known as clean meat – is not vegan as it currently uses cells from animals.  Some scientists also use a bovine growth serum – though there are companies working on making the tech animal-free.  However, some vegans support clean meat because of its potential to dramatically reduce the number of animals slaughtered. "

He is CPG industry vet and Unovis partner: a leading global investment firm disrupting conventional animal agriculture. “In my nearly 25 years in CPG, I haven’t seen anything quite like what Chad and Derek have been able to create with Wicked Foods,” says Speranza.  “Their commitment to producing the most crave-able, sought after, chef-crafted plant-based foods is driving huge demand in the U.K… We know Americans are ready for this genuine and unapologetic approach to plant-based eating.  “Beyond that, it’s not only vegans that are creating demand but also mainstream consumers who want in on alternative protein options that put flavor first.” "
1191,Sainsbury’s To Shut All Meat And Fish Counters Amid COVID: 2 Years After Admitting ‘Decline In Meat Sales’,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/food/meat-and-fish-counters-shut-sainsburys/,2020-05-11,"Supermarket Sainsbury’s will shut down all its meat, fish, and deli counters as the U.K enters its second national COVID-19 lockdown. As a result, 3,500 jobs will be lost. In addition, the retailer has confirmed it plans to shut 120 Argos stores very soon. An additional 420 of the outlets planned to close by 2024. Simon Roberts is chief executive of Sainsbury’s. He discussed the close of meat and fish counters in a statement. He said: “We are talking to colleagues today about where the changes we are announcing in Argos standalone stores and food counters impact their roles. “We will work really hard to find alternative roles for as many of these colleagues as possible. We expect to be able to offer alternative roles for the majority of impacted colleagues. “Right here and now, I and all the team are focused on supporting and delivering for our customers in the days and weeks ahead.” While the store hasn’t said the move will result in selling less meat, nearly two years ago, it admitted that meat sales are on the decline across the industry. As reported by Plant Based News, in January 2019, the retailer made the comments when announcing plans to market vegan meat next to meat counters as a trial. The retailer has now placed meat-alternative products including sausages and burgers next to traditional meat aisles in numerous Sainsbury’s stores. “We were looking at as a business the challenge we face in the future, if we sell less and less meat what do you backfill it with,” James Hamilton, Meat-Free and Ready Meals Buyer at Sainsbury’s, told The Telegraph, adding that the trial was ‘in reaction to a decline in meat sales across the industry’. “So we are supplementing our ranges with alternative proteins and plant-based ranges. We are interested to see what happened. The general market dynamic is that meat is on the decline. “This is a way of giving people more choice and new ideas. People will even if they didn’t buy it will be thinking – is there a different way of doing things. We are appealing to different people than those who shop in our plant-based section.” "

1375,People Are Ditching Meat ‘More Rapidly Than Thought’ New Research Finds,https://plantbasednews.org/uncategorised/flexitarian-sector-growing-faster-than-thought/,2020-09-28,"People across Europe are reducing their meat consumption ‘much more rapidly than thought’, according to  New Food Magazine. Dutch firm ingredients firm Griffith Foods has undertaken a Pan Europeansurvey looking into consumer behavior. It polled around 4,000 people in the U.K, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. The organization says the emerging flexitarian market is larger than previously thought. Flexitarians are people who actively want to reduce their meat intake and try alternative proteins. The survey found that consumers want more ‘adventurous’ vegan and veggie options made available. They want different cuisines including Asian and Mediterranean on offer rather than just standard veggie burgers. It also looked at meat alternatives. Flexitarian shoppers are seeking products with a more meat-like texture than many of the options currently available. Wim van Roekel is president, Griffith Foods, Europe & Africa. He said the research findings ‘may come as a surprise to many’. They identified ‘a new class of casual consumer who are reducing their meat consumption much more rapidly than thought’. “That has major implications for food retail manufacturers and producers, and their response to capture and cater to this newfound mass market. “It’s exciting for our customers. This new demographic, still in its infancy, has a big appetite for choice and change.” "
1418,"$1.5 Billion Invested In Alternative Proteins In 2020, Says Report",https://plantbasednews.org/news/investment-alternative-protein-2020-report/,2020-09-19,"Sustainable alternatives to conventional animal-based foods are attracting substantial investment, according to a first-of-its-kind report by The Good Food Institute.  According to GFI’s fermentation state of the industry report, alternative protein companies raised $1.5 billion in the first seven months of 2020. More specifically, companies devoted to fermentation technology received a record $435 million in venture capital funding over the same period, up from $274 million in 2019. This rapid growth hails microbial fermentation’s emerging role as a ‘third pillar’ of the alternative protein industry, alongside plant-based proteins and cultivated meat.  Innovators such as Impossible Foods and Perfect Day have pioneered tasty, sustainable alternatives to animal protein using fermentation technology. Now several of the world’s largest food and life science companies are tapping into the increasing consumer appetite for plant based alternatives to animal products. Giants such as DuPont and DSM are working on fermentation-derived alternative proteins, while the world’s largest meat company, JBS, is using fermentation to develop their new brand, Planterra Foods.  GFI Executive Director Bruce Friedrich said: “Fermentation’s ability to efficiently produce protein could help feed the world, significantly alleviating global malnutrition. Fermentation could enable companies to meet the growing demand for high-quality protein at a cost that is competitive with or lower than that of animal products. “Microbes and fermented plant proteins can also provide the sensory experiences and full nutritional profiles of animal products but without the range of external costs that come with industrial animal production, from massive contributions to climate change to growing antibiotic resistance and zoonotic diseases.” "
1482,Australian Company To Create Cell-Based Meat From ‘Exotic’ Animals Like Kangaroo And Lion,https://plantbasednews.org/news/australian-company-create-cell-based-meat-from-exotic-animals/,2020-07-09,"Australian company Vow Food has announced plans to create cell-based meat from ‘exotic’ animals such as Kangaroo, Lion, Tortoise, and Yak. The startup’s first creation was cultured Kangaroo meat dumplings which launched back in April 2019. It takes approximately six weeks for Vow to grow the cells into ‘the highest quality meat’. Whilst cultured meat is slaughter-free, it is not by definition vegan as it currently uses cells from animals. Some scientists also use a bovine growth serum – though there are companies working on making the tech animal-free.  However, some vegans support clean meat because of its potential to dramatically reduce the number of animals slaughtered. According to FoodNavigator, Co-founder and Chief Commerical Officer at Vow Foods Tim Noakesmith said: “There have been various historical reports of how delicious the meat of the Galapagos tortoise, or the rich fat of the dugong – but if we tried to turn these animals into food, the likelihood is that we would decimate their populations.” Noakesmith added that its products will create a ‘new category of food’ that offers a ‘unique culinary experience’ that will appeal to ‘different consumer groups’. According to a report by global consultancy AT Kearney, 35 percent of meat will be lab-cultured and 25 percent will be vegan alternatives by 2040. “With the advantages of novel vegan meat replacements and cultured meat over conventionally produced meat, it is only a matter of time before they capture a substantial market share,” the report states.

1536,Prince Khaled-Backed Pet Food Start-Up Creates Animal-Free Chicken,https://plantbasednews.org/news/prince-khaled-backed-pet-food-animal-free-chicken/,2020-08-26,"A tech start-up working to make animal-free and protein-rich pet food has created the world’s first animal-free, cultured chicken meat protein for pet food applications. Bond Pet Foods, which is backed by Prince Khaled bin Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud, says the prototype is ‘a big step’ on its way to scale-up and commercial production. Scientists at Bond Pet Foods uses a ‘proprietary production process’ which it describes as ‘more humane and sustainable’ than conventional agriculture. They take a blood sample (described as ‘harmless’) from a chicken, which is used to determine the genetic code for the best types of chicken proteins to nourish dogs and cats. The genetic code is then coupled with a strain of food-grade yeast. When this yeast is grown in a fermentation tank, it churns out meat proteins that are identical to those typically produced on farm and field. It’s a similar fermentation process that’s been used for half a century to make enzymes for cheese, but Bond is reassembling the process to harvest high-quality animal proteins. According to the company, the product – once fully developed – will have the same ‘primary nutrients of conventional chicken meat including its essential amino acids’, and will meet or exceed AAFCO requirements for both dogs and cats. Its first chicken-based products will debut in 2023. Bond Foods has fed the chicken to dogs, and says there was ‘enthusiastic uptake from dog volunteers’. It is planning to run ‘more robust feeding trials’ in the future. “Our initial tests with dog volunteers have been very promising, and its nutritionals, palatability and digestibility will only improve on our path to commercialization,” Pernilla Audibert, co-founder and CTO of Bond Pet Foods, said in a statement sent to Plant Based News. “The science team at Bond is also working on the production of other cultured meat proteins made through a similar fermentation process. The successful chicken prototype is a demonstration of our technology’s potential to create a complete portfolio of animal proteins for pet consumption, and beyond.”  Rich Kelleman, co-founder and CEO of Bond Pet Foods, added: “A new wave of responsible food production is emerging, working with the best that nature and science has to offer, and our team is leading this wave in Pet. “Our team’s continued developments are laying the foundation to bring high-value meat protein and nutrition to dogs and cats, while removing farm animals from the equation.” Bond Pet Foods has just closed a bridge round of funding, which will be used to expedite its work, with follow-on from seed investors Lever VC and KBW Ventures, and new funds Stage 1 and Trellis Road participating.

The company, which is the largest pig and pork producer in the world, debuted meat-free breakfast patties, meatballs, burger patties, and pre-seasoned protein starters last year. In a recent interview with Food Navigator, Pure Farmland’s Brand Manager Erin Thacker said: “We started looking at plant proteins about two and a half years ago, but we’ve always thought of ourselves as a protein company so it made sense to be in this set [as] we want to offer a variety of protein choices. “We also have a broader range of products than some of our competitors. Overall, we’re very pleased with our velocities and repeat rates across the portfolio; the meatballs and the breakfast items are doing very well.” Thacker did not share any specific figures but did say the plant-based range performed better when displayed amongst other meat-free products. Speaking about the launch of its new meatless line, John Pauley, Chief Commercial Officer for Smithfield Foods, said in a statement: “We’re thrilled to announce the launch of this new product portfolio under our Pure Farmland brand. “We’ve been exploring the alternative protein space, and have taken our time to get it right. “With this launch, we are bringing together our expertise in creating market-leading food products, our organizational commitment to sustainability, and our deep understanding of ‘flexitarian’ consumers, to deliver a broad variety of flavorful plant-based protein choices that consumers want and can afford at a great value.” "

The report by social policy think-tank Demos, titled Turning The Tables, said lack of accessibility to healthy food created ‘significant barriers to eating healthy diets’, with around 20 million Brits struggling to afford it even before the COVID-19 lockdown. Demos’ report follows the U.K government recently unveiling a new strategy to tackle the condition, which it described as ‘one of the greatest long-term health challenges this country faces’. The strategy includes a raft of measures, including a watershed on adverts for unhealthy foods and for menus to display calories among others. According to the U.K government: “The urgency of tackling the obesity time bomb has been brought to the fore by evidence of the link to an increased risk from COVID-19. “Living with excess weight puts people at greater risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19, with risk growing substantially as body mass index (BMI) increases. Nearly eight percent of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in intensive care units have been morbidly obese, compared with 2.9 percent of the general population. “As the government continues to respond to this unprecedented global pandemic, ministers [have] set out a comprehensive package of measures to help people take control of their own future by losing weight, getting active and adopting a healthier lifestyle.” Turning The Tables suggested several recommendations to tackle the obesity crisis. These included a government fund to develop plant-based meat alternatives and cultured meat, subsidies for healthy plant foods like vegetables, and government support for fast-food restaurants to move towards healthier foods. In addition, it said packaging for unhealthy foods – high in fat, sugar, and salt – could adopt packaging changes to make them less appealing (similar to cigarette packs). Rose Lasko-Skinner, one of Demos’s lead researchers, said: “Ultimately that means people are going into a shop and really struggling to come out with something that is both healthy and affordable.” "

The crisis, which has resulted in meat shortages and temporary closure of slaughterhouses around the world, is said to have boosted the sales of plant-based meat as more people are afraid of ‘animal-borne illnesses’. Many high-profile experts and celebs have also warned of the link between factory farming and zoonotic disease outbreaks.  You can read the full report here "
1721,KFC Admits There Is ‘Annual Increase In Demand For Traditional Meat Alternatives’ – And Says How It Will Meet It,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/kfc-increase-demand-alternatives-traditional-meat/,2020-07-21,"KFC has revealed there is an ‘annual increase in demand for alternatives to traditional meat’ – and says it is working to create 3D-printed chicken nuggets made from plant matter and chicken cells to meet it. The fast-food chain is currently working with the 3D Bioprinting Solutions research laboratory in Moscow, and has plans to have a final product for testing by the fall of 2020. According to KFC, the bioprinting method has several advantages over traditional farming, saying the final product is ‘cleaner’ than traditional meat, as well as more ethical. “At KFC, we are closely monitoring all of the latest trends and innovations and doing our best to keep up with the times by introducing advanced technologies to our restaurant networks,” said Raisa Polyakova, General Manager of KFC Russia & CIS. “Crafted meat products are the next step in the development of our ‘restaurant of the future’ concept. Our experiment in testing 3D bioprinting technology to create chicken products can also help address several looming global problems.  “We are glad to contribute to its development and are working to make it available to thousands of people in Russia and, if possible, around the world.” The move has been branded a ‘game-changer’ by expert Bruce Friedrich, executive director of The Good Food Institute, who praised KFC saying it has ‘rocketed ahead in the race to recreate meat, positioning itself to be the world’s first restaurant chain to bring real chicken grown directly from the cell to consumers’. In a statement sent to Plant Based News, Friedrich said: “It’s remarkable and inspiring to see KFC-Russia investing in new ways of making meat. The U.S. needs to catch up and we hope it creates something like the space race but focused on growing healthy and sustainable meat from cells in a cost-effective manner and bringing that meat to the world,” he said. “KFC is the first restaurant brand in the world to cast its lot with cultivated meat, and the chain is all in, promising a cultivated meat prototype this year.” Friedrich added that on the same day KFC announced its cultivated meat endeavor in Russia, it revealed that it would be rolling out its plant-based Beyond Fried Chicken across Southern California. “KFC is synonymous with chicken, and so it is exciting to see the chain rethinking what chicken means,” he said. “As one of the most iconic restaurant brands in the world, when KFC talks, the worldwide meat industry listens. So we think this could be a game-changer for the industry. “This could be the biggest moment for alternative proteins in 2020, especially if KFC-Russia follows through with its plans to host a cultivated meat tasting in the fall as promised and if Beyond Fried Chicken rolls out nationally.” "
1854,"Meat Industry Will ‘Inevitably’ Be Obsolete in 15 Years, Says Impossible Foods CEO",https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/meat-industry-obsolete-in-15-years-says-impossible-foods/,2020-06-26,"Impossible Foods CEO Patrick Brown has said the meat industry will be obsolete in 15 years, describing the ‘transformation’ to plant-based products as ‘inevitable’. Brown, whose company recently won a legal battle against Nestlé due to the name of its plant-based burger, made the comment in a recent interview with CNBC‘s Jim Cramer. “From a nutritional standpoint, our products match the protein quality and content of the animal products that they replace… Ours is a clear winner from a health and nutrition standpoint,” Brown said. “This is why I think people are increasingly aware plant-based products are going to completely replace the animal-based products in the food world within the next 15 years. That’s our mission. That transformation is inevitable.” According to a report by global consultancy AT Kearney, a staggering 60 percent of the meat consumed in 2040 will not come from dead animals. The report predicts that 35 percent of meat will be lab-cultured and 25 percent will be vegan alternatives. AT Kearney predicts that cultured meat will become more popular than meat alternatives in the long run, because of its ability to mimic conventional meat more closely – though it does concede there are likely to be regulatory issues in the short term.

1892,Meat Giant Launches Vegan Protein As Demand Surges Amid Pandemic,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/meat-giant-jbs-vegan-protein-demand-surges-pandemic/,2020-06-19,"The wold’s world’s largest meat company has launched a vegan meat range as demand for alternative protein surges amid the coronavirus pandemic. The new line, called Ozo, was created by Brazillian meat giant JBS. It will include burgers, ground, Mexican-seasoned ground and Italian-style meatballs made from pea protein and will launch in stores including Albertsons and Safeway locations in Rocky Mountain states, and Kroger in 12 states. Darcey Macken is the CEO of Planterra Foods – a subsidiary of JBS USA where Ozo is being developed. She told Forbes: “We’re not saying that meat is bad. People getting their heads wrapped around plants can be for all different motivations, whether it’s about earth and sustainability or just not eating animals.” The coronavirus seems to have had a significant impact on consumers opting for plant-based alternatives: according to data from the Plant Based Foods Association (PBFA), sales of vegan foods increased by 90 percent (compared to the same period last week) during the third week of March – when most shutdowns started in the U.S. A month later, they were still 27 percent higher. Speaking about how the growth of plant-based sales was outpacing the growth of total food sales, Julie Emmett, senior director of retail partnerships at the Plant Based Foods Association, said: “This new data shows that consumers are turning to plant-based food options now more than ever. “Even after the highest panic-buying period, plant-based foods growth remains strong, proving that this industry has staying power.” Tony Olson, owner and CEO of retail insight company SPINS, added: “Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been a continued shift in consumer purchasing toward natural and organic products that enhance health and immunity. “Our data shows, the plant-based meat boom of last year continues and as reports of animal-based meat shortages increase, we can expect plant-based meat to gain even more traction.” There are a multiple reasons suggested for this surge: the coronavirus pandemic has had a well-documented impact on the meat industry: U.S. slaughterhouses were branded ‘COVID-19 hotpots’ by a top analyst earlier this year. High infection rates led to more than 20 meat processing plants across the country being shuttered. This led to farmers killing animals in a practice the industry calls ‘depopulating’ – which takes them out of the food supply. This, a Bloomberg report said, meant customers were finding themselves in ’empty meat aisles, searching for protein’. These meat shortages in some stores, as well as concerns over safety, could be behind the boost in plant-based food sales. Jeff Crumpton, manager of retail reporting at SPINS, told Forbes: “A lot of these hot spots are in meat processing facilities, and consumers are understandably concerned. “They are seeing all these cases, and have this other solution, this other product that maybe they really like. It feels like a safer alternative, and it’s something that they can get their hands on.” "
1910,U.K Tofu Brand Expands Factory Capacity By 70% To Meet Huge Demand,https://plantbasednews.org/news/tofu-brand-expands-factory-capacity-huge-demand/,2020-06-16,"A leading U.K tofu brand is expanding its factory capacity to meet the growing demand for its products. The Tofoo Co says it will install a Soy Milk Cooker from Japan, which will allow its company turnover to increase from £14 million per annum to almost £20 million by next year. The company has seen massive growth since it was bought in 2016. It now has 93 full-time staff members, and offers a range of 10 products, which are available in major supermarkets including Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Ocado, and Co-op. In a statement sent to Plant Based News, David Knibbs, Managing Director of The Tofoo Co. said: “The arrival and installation of the new milk cooker marks a further one million pound investment at the Tofoo factory.” He added: “Trends suggest that interest in trying tofu has increased, and with cafés and restaurants currently closed, people are experimenting more with what they can cook at home. “The tofu category penetration is continuing to increase, up 40 percent compared to two years ago, and its share in meat-free is growing month on month. The category has also added over 500,000 households in one year, however, there are currently 5.8 million households eating meat-free who aren’t trying tofu. The opportunity for growth within the sector is significant.” Polling released at the end of April shows that Brits may be more open to trying alternative proteins: more than 13 million cut down on meat consumption during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a survey conducted by The Vegan Society. According to the organization, the data highlights how ‘pressures on supermarkets and consumers alike are changing buying behavior towards a more ethical, compassionate alternative’. In addition to cutting meat consumption, 15 percent of respondents said they have reduced their dairy/egg intake over the lockdown period. The Vegan Society spokesperson Matt Turner told PBN it’s ‘no surprise that many consumers have made the switch to plant-based alternatives during the COVID-19 pandemic’, adding that the reasons for doing so include ‘convenience, cost, or concern for their own wellbeing, the environment and the rights of animals’. He said: “Many Brits are trying these alternatives for the first time and enjoying them so much that they intend on keeping them in their shopping basket when we return to normal times. “They are purchasing items that they wouldn’t have given a second look a few months ago, but are now seeing these brilliant vegan alternatives as the new normal.” "
1930,"Factory Farms Should Be ‘Discontinued’ To Protect Humans, Says Scientists In New Paper",https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/factory-farms-should-be-discontinued-to-protect-humans/,2020-12-06,"A new paper examines the current COVID-19 outbreak – and says we should stop factory farming for the ‘sake of animals, humans, and the environment’. The paper, titled What the COVID-19 Pandemic is Telling Humanity, is published in the journal Kargar. It was penned by David O. Wiebers, MD, Emeritus Professor of Neurology at the Mayo Clinic, and Valery Feigin, MD, of New Zealand’s National Institute for Stroke and Applied Neurosciences. Laying out the current situation, the authors say the world is ‘enveloped in a global health emergency that is exacting enormous medical and economic tolls upon humanity’. They describe how the SARS-CoV-2 that has caused the current COVID-19 pandemic is ‘thought to have originated in bats and, via an intermediary such as the pangolin, to have found its way from a ‘wet market’ where live wildlife species were being sold for human consumption in Wuhan, China, to one or more humans at that location’. The medical community has found itself on the frontline of the crisis, both in treating patients, and racing to find a vaccine for the virus, they say. Meanwhile, politicians are attempting to ‘mitigate the overwhelming societal and economic devastations that are unfolding’. The paper considers how it is ‘imperative for us as a society and species to focus and reflect deeply upon what this and other related human health crises are telling us about our role in these increasingly frequent events’ – as well as how we can try to stave off such situations in the future. The authors note that according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ‘…three in every four new or emerging infectious diseases in people come from animals’. “The alarming increase in frequency of these lethal zoonotic diseases relates in large part to our human-dominated ecosystem with increasingly unnatural human-animal close contact, grossly aberrant crowding of animals for human purposes, destruction of animal habitats, and vast numbers of highly mobile humans to swiftly carry these diseases throughout the world,” says the paper. The authors are decisive in what action they believe should be taken to help prevent further pandemics. They write: “Intensive confinement of animals in factory farm operations should be discontinued worldwide for the sake of animals, humans, and the environment, and we should rapidly evolve to eating other forms of protein that are safer for humans, including plant-based meat alternatives and cultured meat (produced by culturing animal cells).” They add that investing in plant-based agriculture and growing crops for human consumption rather than livestock would be more efficient in feeding more people while using less land and water. This, they say, would allow ‘for the preservation of vital ecosystems for innumerable species’. They conclude: “Ultimately, the survival, not only of other life forms on this planet, but also of our own, will depend upon humanity’s ability to recognize the oneness of all that exists and the importance and deeper significance of compassion for all life.” This paper follows numerous doctors speaking out about the public health risks of factory farming. Dr. Gemma Newman – also known as the Plant Powered Doctor – is a senior partner at a UK medical practice. She described factory farms as a ‘ticking timebomb’ while speaking about the dangers of industrial meat production while supporting the No Meat May campaign. “Some politicians and commentators blame China for Covid-19, but they do not mention that all of the recent major disease outbreaks have been caused by tampering with animals and their habitats, or that our chicken salad and pepperoni pizza could be the next big health risk,” Dr. Newman said in a statement sent to Plant Based News. “The inconvenient truth is that factory farms put a strain on animal health, which means we treat them with antibiotics and small doses end up in your meal. suggests an extra 10 million people may die by 2050 as a result of antibiotic resistance, and we can add viral pandemics to these figures too. This current crisis shows us that we are not prepared for the future we are creating. “Our industrial-scale factory farms are like a ticking time bomb – yet I can guarantee that lentils will not spark a viral pandemic anytime soon. Many of us are sitting at home wondering what we can do to help this situation. Taking some time to reflect on what we eat, limiting the meat we put in our supermarket trolley, and shifting to a more plant-based diet will help us move towards a safer future. Signing up to the campaign is a lovely way to feel supported in reducing meat consumption moving forwards.” "
2003,Plant-Based Egg Company Ventures Into Cultured Meat As ‘Demand For Animal Protein Is Exploding’,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/vegan-egg-company-ventures-into-lab-meat/,2020-05-31,"Plant-based egg maker JUST is venturing into cultured meat as the ‘demand for animal protein is exploding‘.  The company, which recently revealed it had sold the vegan equivalent of 40 million chicken eggs, says plant-based foods alone will not end the need for slaughtering animals.  In its 2020 impact report, JUST states there is not enough water and ‘arable land’ to feed enough animals to meet the current demand for conventional meat – and highlights the environmental impact of ‘burning down rainforests to grow more feed’. “So, in addition to plant-based innovation, JUST is developing cultured meat — it’s real meat grown from cells, without ever needing to confine or slaughter an animal,” the brand states. “As we researched more of the functional potential of plants, we found that they can do even more than create plant-based foods: they can enable animal cells to grow sustainably and efficiently outside of an animal. “The truth is that it’s unlikely that the families in Birmingham, Brussels, or Beijing will consistently choose plant-based alternatives over chicken, beef, pork, and seafood. We love plant-based foods, but they, alone, will not let us achieve our mission.” JUST first announced it was working on cultured meat – produced by extracting cells from a living animal which are then placed in a ‘nutrient-rich environment’ – back in 2017. It has not confirmed when the product, which is not considered vegan, will be available to the public.  You can read JUST’s 2020 impact report here "
2058,"COVID-19 Impact Could Help Plant-Based Meat Industry, Says Analyst",https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/covid-19-help-plant-based-meat-industry-analyst/,2020-05-20,"Impact from the COVID-19 pandemic could boost plant-based meat sales, an analyst has said. Donald McLee, an analyst at Berenberg, spoke to the Financial Times earlier this month. McLee said growth trajectory could ‘skew higher’ as a result of consumer stockpiling and recent slaughterhouse closures.  He said these could lead to potential meat shortages which would encourage people to try alternative proteins. U.S. plant-meat giants Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have both recently taken steps to expand their retail potential. A significant amount of revenue for both companies was tied to food service – which has taken a serious hit due to coronavirus lockdowns. According to reports, Impossible Foods has announced its intention to increase its retail footprint 18-fold this year, and will debut in 1,700 Kroger stores nationwide. Impossible CEO Pat Brown said the company is ‘selling as much as we can produce’. It has also cut its wholesale price. Beyond Meat has also revealed the steps it is taking to mitigate its hospitality losses, with CEO Ethan Brown announcing that the company has seen a ‘meaningful slowdown in [its] foodservice business during the latter half of March’ as a result of lockdowns. During a recent earnings call, Brown said: “We are not idly waiting for circumstances to accommodate our planned growth trajectory…As the pandemic began to interrupt the world economy, we created offensive and defensive teams across the company to guide our navigation of the changing landscape.”? The measures the company will implement include developing ‘value packs’ of products, offering ‘more aggressive’ pricing, and building a direct-to-consumer operation, which he said would launch later this quarter.

2064,World’s First Vegan Spam To Launch As COVID-19 Spurs Interest In Alternative Protein,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/worlds-first-vegan-spam-launch-covid-19-alternative-protein/,2020-05-19,"A new vegan spam product – reportedly the first of its kind in the world – is now available at a Hong Kong eatery, with plans to roll out further this Summer. Omnipork Luncheon was created by Onmifoods – the company behind plant-based pork alternative Omnipork. David Yeung, the founder of Omnipork and co-founder of advocacy organization Green Monday, announced the product earlier this week. The brand is also launching Omnistrip – a plant-based alternative to pork shoulder. Spam is a hugely popular product across Asia, but as a processed meat, carries a number of health risks. Omnipork Luncheon is 49 percent lower in fat and 62 percent lower in sodium than its pork-based counterpart. It is also cholesterol-free and does not contain carcinogenic nitrates. According to Yeung: “Luncheon meat is a food that everyone in Asia has a love-hate relationship with.” He added: “Eating isn’t just about filling up our stomachs and absorbing the daily nutrition we need. It’s also about satisfying our cravings. So I am very excited to finally provide a healthier plant-based alternative.” Yeung also addressed the connection between using animals and the emergence of disease, saying ‘coronavirus is not the first disease and won’t be the last to affect us unless we change our diet’. According to the BBC: “As China recovers from the coronavirus outbreak, more people are looking to lead healthier lifestyles.” As a result, interest in alternative protein in the country is growing, with Beyond Meat launching in Starbucks stores across China alongside Omnipork, as part of what the BBC describes as ‘hope to tap into a growing demand for meat substitutes in China following a global trend to eat less meat and more plant-based foods’. Companies like Beyond Meat have targetted Asia as a significant market, with a company spokesperson saying: “We see Asia as a key region for strategic long-term growth and Beyond Meat’s goal is to have localized production within Asia by the end of 2020.” "
2096,$741 Million Already Invested In Plant-Based Protein In 2020,https://plantbasednews.org/news/741-million-invested-plant-based-protein-2020/,2020-05-13,"A staggering $741 million has been invested in alternative protein already in 2020, according to a new report released today by nonprofit The Good Food Institute (GFI). GFI’s state of the industry reports analyze investment activity in companies creating alternatives to conventional animal-based foods. One of its reports includes U.S. plant-based meat, egg, and dairy companies, and the other focuses on global cultivated meat companies. The reports show that 2019 was a record-breaking year for U.S. plant-based meat, egg, and dairy companies, who received more than $747 million in investments. Global cultivated meat companies raised more than $77 million in capital in 2019, for a total of $824 million in alternative proteins. Investment in U.S. plant-based meat, egg, and dairy companies in just the first quarter of 2020 was a staggering $741 million – even as Covid-19 has disrupted global markets – almost as much as for the entirety of 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, cultivated meat companies raised $189 million, more than the amount invested in the cultivated meat industry’s prior history, taking investments in alternative protein up to $930 million. “There’s been a surge in investor confidence fueled by durable and increasing consumer interest in alternative proteins,” GFI associate director of corporate engagement Caroline Bushnell, said in a statement sent to Plant Based News. “Investors have seen the market opportunity and are moving to capitalize on a global shift in the way meat is produced. “This record-level investment will bolster the industry and support continued growth and innovation for the long term, ensuring that alternative protein companies have the resources to grow and thrive, particularly during times of short-term market volatility. “The Covid-19 crisis has made bolstering our global protein supply more critical than ever, given the inherent – and now very apparent – vulnerability of supply chains dependent on industrial animal agriculture.” “Plant-based and cultivated meats give consumers everything they like about meat but produced more sustainably,” added GFI executive director Bruce Friedrich. “Most of the conventional meat companies have reconstituted as protein companies, and nine of the 10 biggest have either launched or invested in plant-based meat, cultivated meat, or both. “With historic pressures on conventional meat production, we expect to see the large meat conglomerates double down on their alternative protein investments.” "
2139,"Slashing Global Meat Demand Would Cut Pandemic Risk, Says Tech Firm",https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/slashing-global-meat-demand-cut-pandemic-risk/,2020-06-05,"A ‘significant reduction in global meat demand would probably be extremely helpful in stemming the tide of zoonotic disease outbreaks’, according to a major tech company. IDTechEx, which provides business intelligence on emerging technologies, has compiled a report on cultured meat – questioning whether it could ‘reduce the world’s reliance on the problematic animal agriculture industry’. Cultured meat – often referred to as clean or lab meat – is not vegan as it is derived from animal cells. There is currently no set date for it to enter the retail or hospitality sectors, though some companies – notably Memphis Meats – are working with regulatory agencies to bring their products to market. One of the major issues IDTechEx identifies with industrial meat production is the role factory farming plays in disease outbreaks and transmission. It describes the current COVID-19 pandemic as ‘just the latest zoonotic disease stemming from the meat industry’. “The problem of wet markets and zoonoses is just part of the wider issue of zoonotic disease outbreaks linked with the global meat industry,” the company said in a statement sent to Plant Based News. “Any system involving an extremely high density of animals in contact with human will lead to risks of disease transmission. “This is particularly problematic in intensive animal farming systems, where there is often very little genetic diversity between animals, meaning a disease can rapidly spread without meeting any resistance from genetic variants.” A number of experts have predicted that future outbreaks are likely unless major changes are made to the way humans interact with animals. IDTechEx’s report concurs with this, saying the likely increasingly common future zoonotic disease outbreaks will ‘stem from animal agriculture intensifying as the world struggles to feed its burgeoning population and growing wealth in low-income countries leads to increasing demand for meat’.  As a solution, the company says a significant reduction in global meat demand would likely help, though it admits that such a reduction could be difficult to achieve. “As such, there is a large opportunity for any company that can create a completely realistic substitute for meat products,” it says. “Any substitute would need to be almost indistinguishable from conventional meat, have at least price parity with corresponding meat products, and be widely available.” It adds that ‘in theory, cultured meat could solve many of the problems associated with the global meat industry’, as it would reduce the potential of disease transmission as well as offering ‘various environmental and ethical benefits’. There are issues though: “The industry is still in its infancy and there are many unanswered questions around cultured meat. Consumers are notoriously skeptical of biotechnology in food and the concept of lab-grown meat could be unnatural and unappealing.” As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ensuing recession, the UK government is being urged to implement a tax on meat and dairy, as the animal agriculture industry poses health and environmental hazards. Animal advocacy organization PETA has written to Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak suggesting that the revenue from such a tax could be used to ease the burden on the NHS and help farmers transition away from meat and dairy to more climate-friendly arable ventures. PETA notes that outbreaks of swine flu, avian flu, SARS, HIV, foot-and-mouth disease, mad cow disease, and other zoonotic diseases have stemmed from capturing wild animals or farming animals for food. The letter says meat and dairy should ‘take their place alongside tobacco, alcohol, sugar, and fuel – all of which are taxed because of their negative impact on human health or the environment’. It adds: “This would lighten the burden on the already overstretched NHS: modeling predicts that a UK tax on red and processed meats could result in 22 percent fewer deaths and save the health service £700 million a year.” "

2388,Top Scientists Awarded $4 Million To Research Into Plant-Based And Cultivated Meat,https://plantbasednews.org/news/scientists-awarded-4-million-to-research-plant-based-meat/,2020-03-23,"4,000,000 USD has been awarded to 21 of the world’s leading scientists from nine different countries to research into plant-based and cultivated meat. Awarded by The Good Food Institute’s (GFI) Competitive Grant Program from visionary donors, the funding has been allocated to ‘top biochemists, tissue engineers, computational modeling experts, plant geneticists, and food scientists’. The 2020 grantees aim to ‘address the crucial technical bottlenecks facing the plant-based and cultivated meat industries, with research specifically focused on taste, texture, cost, and scale-up improvements’. In a statement sent to Plant Based News, GFI’s Associate Director of Science and Technology Erin Rees Clayton said: “If we want to see plant-based and cultivated meat become an integral part of the global food supply, we must fill critical white spaces in research. “As we work to find sustainable approaches to meeting the global demand for meat, this funding will enable us to bridge key gaps in alternative protein research, addressing unanswered questions and unmet technological needs.” Bruce Friedrich, Executive Director at GFI, added: “Plant-based meat and cultivated meat have the potential to transform the global food system, but this requires the industries to overcome significant technical hurdles that remain on the path to price parity, scaleup, and commercialization. “Building a robust foundation of open-access data will enable the entire sector to advance more efficiently and bring plant-based and cultivated meat to the masses.” "
2434,Meat Giants Try To Address Environmental Concerns – By Adding Veggies To Products,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/meat-giants-environmental-concerns-adding-veggies/,2020-03-16,"Multiple meat companies are creating ‘blended’ products like burgers, meatballs, and sausages – which all contain vegetables too. According to AP, the reason giants like Tyson, Applegate, and Perdue Farms are adding these plant-foods to meat products is to assuage consumer fears over the impact meat has on the planet and human health. Environmental organization Greenpeace USA has previously called on Americans to reduce their meat intake, saying: “The research is clear – a diet heavy in meat increases the risk of obesity, cancer, and heart disease. “But it also makes the planet sick. The livestock sector – raising cows, pigs, and chickens – generates as much greenhouse gas emissions as all cars, trucks, and automobiles combined. Cattle ranchers have clear cut millions of square kilometers of forests for grazing pastures, decimating natural ‘carbon sinks’. “We’re not advocating that everyone adopt a ‘meatless’ diet tomorrow. But we all must develop ‘meat consciousness’ and reduce the level of meat in our diets.” Greenpeace is not alone in calling on consumers to eat fewer animals. Last year, the United Nations said agriculture and food production generates 37 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions – and reducing meat will help. Last year Tyson Foods, the largest meat producer in the U.S, launched its ‘Raised and Rooted’ range of products, which features items like a beef burger bulked out with pea protein, which it says makes it healthier and more sustainable than a standard patty. Speaking at the launch, Justin Whitmore, Tyson’s executive vice president of alternative proteins and chief sustainability officer, said: “I think if you look at the shape of the demand that’s happening in alternative protein, you’re seeing a lot of it’s being driven by consumers who like meat – and consumers who will continue to eat meat as part of their diets.” This type of product has also been seen in the UK: last year, budget retailer Aldi started selling patties made from beef and beans, branding them ‘flexitarian’. Meat companies describe consumers who opt for these types of products as ‘conscientious carnivores’, with Applegate President John Ghingo saying: “People want changes they can make that are pragmatic and help them move the needle.” But for many vegans, these types of ranges are just a bid to appease customers, without actually making meaningful changes to the global food system. Posting to the Aldi UK Facebook group when the flexitarian burger launched, Laura Paterson, from Nottingham said: “Flexitarian is not a thing. You either eat meat or you don’t.

Singapore-based TurtleTree Labs, which was co-founded by CEO Fengru Lin, CSO Rabail Toor, and Chief Strategist Max Rye, has just completed its pre-seed funding round. According to TurtleTree, it has developed a ‘unique proprietary technology that uses mammary cells to produce real, full milk in clean food production facilities’. The end product being the same as human breast milk and cow milk and will be sold as a food product – meaning it has the potential to disrupt the existing baby formula industry. “The seed funding will be used to further build out the company’s scientific team and to create additional prototypes. TurtleTree Labs plans to publicly debut the world’s first cultivated milk products in the Spring,” said Rye. Lin added that the company will now bring in ‘the right talent’ needed for rapid acceleration. “We believe the entire landscape of traditional bovine milk will be transformed as a result of our technology,” she said. The pre-seed round was led by Lever VC, a venture capital fund specializing in alternative protein investments. Nick Cooney, Founder and Managing Partner at Lever VC, said: “What TurtleTree Labs is doing is fascinating, and their technology could be a serious disruptor in the global dairy industry. “They are the first company in the world producing real, whole milk from cell cultivation – which opens the door for safer, healthier and customized dairy products that can be produced with far fewer natural resources.” “KBW Ventures’ interest in TurtleTree stems from both from the team vision and the company’s strategic approach to the future of food using stem cell technology,” said Prince Khaled bin Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud, founder and Chief Executive Officer, KBW Ventures. “Having spent time with the founding team in Singapore, we have a lot of confidence in TurtleTree’s progress as a biotech company and in the direction they are taking from a business perspective.” "
2953,Plant-Based Fish Brand Banned From Major Seafood Expo,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/plant-based-fish-banned-major-seafood-expo/,2019-12-12,"A plant-based fish company has hit back after being banned from exhibiting at a major seafood expo next year. The three-day Seafood Expo North America 2020 says it won’t allow Atlantic Natural Food to showcase its Linda Loma TUNO product under a new policy. “One of the unique aspects of Seafood Expo North America for our attending buyers is that we are specifically seafood-focused compared to other general food events,” Liz Plizga, group vice president for Diversified told Undercurrent News. “As we are monitoring this alternative protein option, for 2020, it has been determined that protein products be limited to seafood proteins, where a majority of the product’s ingredients need to be seafood or aquatic in nature. “Similarly, buyers would not find chicken, pork, or beef products exhibited at the event.” But Atlantic Natural founder Doug Hines has blasted this policy, saying: “Despite having seaweed and algae in our product, we were denied admittance to the show. “We’re not tolerating this non-acceptance and will continue our unwavering mission to help the world feed nine plus billion people by the year 2050 through our line of plant-based products while saving the oceans.” The Good Food Institute believes the policy stifles innovation when it comes to alternative protein development. “The move to disallow the participation of a plant-based seafood company limits the growth of a sustainable, healthy, and just method of producing the same seafood products that consumers want,” GFI’s Sustainable Seafood Initiative Manager, Jen Lamy, said in a statement sent to Plant Based News. “Ensuring that these alternative methods of production are available to buyers in convenient settings like Seafood Expo North America will enhance and increase consumer choice.” "
3177,Meat Giant Vion Turns Beef Facility Into ‘Dedicated Plant-Based Site’,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/meat-giant-turns-beef-facility-plant-based/,2019-03-11,"Dutch meat giant Vion has announced it will turn one of its beef processing facilities into a ‘dedicated plant-based site’.  The facility was built in 2017 and adheres to the latest standards, which means it can be ‘easily adjusted to become suitable for plant-based production’. The site can be scaled up to add more production lines, freezing facilities, and larger storage capacity.  “The capacity for livestock processing in the Netherlands has grown significantly in the past two years and has proven to be more than sufficient to meet the demand,” CEO Ronal Lottgerink said in a statement. “Given the knowledge we gained from our investment a few years ago, we are now making the strategic choice to invest in a dedicated plant-based site in Leeuwarden. Lotgerink also said it looks forward to welcoming ‘arable farmers as new suppliers in [its] plant-based chain’.  Last month, Vion debuted its plant-based range ME-AT at the Anuga trade fair in Cologne – in response to the ‘growing’ demand for alternative proteins.   “The products will offer the taste, texture and eating experience of traditional meat,” Vion’s website states. “ME-AT is, therefore, broadening the definition of meat, and focusing on the growing target group of future customers: the flexitarian.” "

Products in the line will include breakfast patties, meatballs, burger patties, and pre-seasoned protein starters. According to the company, which is the largest pig and pork producer in the world, the products are all made in the USA, offer a good source of protein, and are gluten-free. “We’re thrilled to announce the launch of this new product portfolio under our Pure Farmland brand. We’ve been exploring the alternative protein space, and have taken our time to get it right,” John Pauley, Chief Commercial Officer for Smithfield Foods, said in a statement.  “With this launch, we are bringing together our expertise in creating market-leading food products, our organizational commitment to sustainability, and our deep understanding of ‘flexitarian’ consumers, to deliver a broad variety of flavorful plant-based protein choices that consumers want and can afford at a great value.” Smithfield has come under fire in the past over its treatment of animals, with vegan charity PETA saying: “Smithfield Foods kills almost 30 million pigs every year – more than any other company in the world.  “The way that Smithfield treats pigs, from birth to slaughter, could result in felony cruelty-to-animals charges if pigs were covered by the same laws that are designed to protect dogs and cats from abuse.” In addition, the company has been forced to make large payouts as a result of causing a nuisance to neighbors through the release of deeply unpleasant odors from its facilities.

3885,"Quorn Vegan Protein ‘Builds Better Muscle’ Than Milk Protein, Says Study",https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/quorn-vegan-protein-better-muscle-than-milk-protein/,2019-05-07,"New research from the University of Exeter has found that Quorn protein can build muscle better than milk protein. According to the University, the study’ evaluated the digestion of protein, which allows amino acids (the building blocks of protein) to increase in the bloodstream and then become available for muscle protein’. To test this, scientists found 20 healthy, trained young men who underwent a strenuous resistance exercise. After the exercise, the men were given either milk or mycoprotein – the vegan protein found in Quorn (though many of the brand’s products have added egg, so are not vegan). Their muscle building rates were measured using in the hours following protein consumption. According to researchers, the results showed that while those who ingested milk protein increased their muscle building rates by up to 60 percent, those who had mycoprotein increased their muscle growth rates (MGRs) by more than double this. As a result, they said mycoprotein is a more effective source of protein to promote muscle growth, than milk. “These results are very encouraging when we consider the desire of some individuals to choose non-animal derived sources of protein to support muscle mass maintenance or adaptations with training,” Dr. Benjamin Wall, Associate Professor of Nutritional Physiology, University of Exeter, said in a statement. “Our data show that mycoprotein can stimulate muscles to grow faster in the hours following exercise compared with a typical animal comparator protein (milk protein) – we look forward to seeing whether these mechanistic findings translate to longer-term training studies in various populations.” “We’re excited to see this data being presented by the University of Exeter at ECSS. In a world where many people are trying to cut back on their meat consumption, either for environmental or health reasons, we’re happy to be able to offer an alternative protein that can provide exceptional nutrition and muscle growth, all while being meat-free,” Tim Finnigan, Chief Scientific Adviser for Quorn Foods, added.

4019,"Most Meat In 2040 ‘Will Be Vegan Or Cultured – Not From Dead Animals’, Says Report",https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/60-meat-2040-vegan-cultured-not-dead-animals/,2019-12-06,"A staggering 60 percent of the meat consumed in 2040 will not come from dead animals, according to a new report. The report, by global consultancy AT Kearney, predicts that 35 percent of meat will be lab-cultured and 25 percent will be vegan alternatives. These predictions were based on interviews with experts, who cited environmental impact and animal welfare concerns as reasons behind the growing interest in alternative protein. “The large-scale livestock industry is viewed by many as an unnecessary evil,” the report says. “With the advantages of novel vegan meat replacements and cultured meat over conventionally produced meat, it is only a matter of time before they capture a substantial market share.” AT Kearney predicts that cultured meat will become more popular than meat alternatives in the long run, because of its ability to mimic conventional meat more closely – though it does concede there are likely to be regulatory issues in the short term. Lab cultured meat – best known as clean meat – is not vegan, as it currently uses cells from animals. Some scientists also use a bovine growth serum – though there are companies working on making the tech animal-free. Some vegans support clean meat because of its potential to dramatically reduce the number of animals slaughtered. Talking about the rise of vegan meat alternatives, the report says: “No animal ingredients are required as these products are completely made of plant-based inputs Nevertheless, their sensory profile gets a lot closer to meat than classic vegan meat replacements. “The main reason for the improved sensory profile is a sophisticated production process with the use of hemoglobin and binders, extracted via fermentation from plants, which imitates the sensory profile of meat and even blood to complete the meat-like experience. “Start-ups in this field, such as Impossible Foods, Just, and Beyond Meat, evolved around 2010 and have received substantial financing (totaling around $900 million up to 2018). Their products are already available in restaurants and supermarkets in several countries.” "

The chain’s US President, Kevin Hochman, also revealed he is in discussion with ‘some of the big guys, just to figure out — what does alternative protein look like in chicken?’. Hochman told CNN the company is meeting with major suppliers of plant-based meat to ‘understand the market and where it’s headed’. In response to launching a plant-based meat alternative, Hochman told Business Insider: “If you would have asked me six months ago, I would have said no, to be completely honest with you…Because we’re about fried chicken.” Hochman added: “Never say never. I would have said never six months ago…Now, I’ve really re-thought that. We’re going to learn more about that. … It still feels a little early, but we’re going to learn about it.” In the UK, KFC is already working on developing a vegan chicken burger, which was recently tested by TV presenter Nisha Katona. “Oh my heaven! On a dream job today- filming for the BBC One Show with exclusive access to the actual KFC headquarters development kitchen. Also, I was the first member of the public to taste the new vegan chicken burger. This to me is actually living the dream,” Katona tweeted. Responding to comments, Katona described the burger as a ‘brilliant product’, adding: ‘[KFC] are still working on it but truly great start.” "

In an interview with Business Insider, the eatery’s Executive Director, Amanda Norris, said the company is ‘always interested in what’s happening in food’. She added: “Specifically … a vegetarian option or a vegan option is something we’re looking at, we’re thinking about and have some [research and development]. “We’re certainly wanting to broaden our thinking and really start big in that funnel and come down… We think it is certainly beyond just no meat on salads or no meat in a wrap. It might be some kind of alternative protein on a sandwich.” Norris also told Business Insider it can take from 18 to 24 months for a new menu item to go from ‘a spark of inspiration to being served in stores’. Chick-fil-A, well known for its chicken sandwiches, currently offers a few items on its menus that can be customized for vegans, but currently, there isn’t any vegetarian or vegan main entreés. Veganuary state the chain’s plant-based offerings include Waffle Potato Fries, Hash Browns (Breakfast Only), Plain Bagels, and a Fruit Cup. Chick-fil-A is unpopular with many consumers due to its history of donating large amounts of money to anti-LGBTQ charities. According to ThinkProgress, the chicken outlet donated ‘more than $1.8 million to a trio of groups with a record of anti-LGBTQ discrimination’ in 2017 – an increase from the year before, despite the company’s ‘latest claims that it has no political or social agenda’.

4226,Meat Giant Tyson To Launch Vegan Meat This Summer,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/meat-giant-tyson-launch-vegan-meat-this-summer/,2019-07-05,"Meat giant Tyson Foods will be launching vegan meat this Summer. The company previously invested in Beyond Meat but sold its stake before the vegan startup went public last week. Now Tyson wants to capitalize on changing consumer tastes via its own products. According to Tyson CEO Noel White, its new vegan will launch within the next few months, rolling out further in October and November. The food giant revealed in February that it was investing resources in developing ‘great tasting protein alternatives that are more accessible for everyone’, with Noel White adding that the plant-based food sector is ‘growing rapidly’ compared to meat and poultry – and vegan products are consumed by a range of people, not just vegans. “It’s not either, it’s and. Flexitarian right? That’s where the growth is at,”White said. “There’s a growing number of people that want to eat a product that they view as being healthier for them and it may be non-animal protein, it may be a blended protein. “We have teams of people committed to bringing these products to market quickly. It’s an area that we are investing in sizably and we will be in market this calendar year – and maybe sooner than you think.”?  Former Tyson CEO Tom Haynes speaking about plant-based protein in 2017 The launch isn’t Tyson’s first foray into the meatless sector; last year it announced the launch of its range of plant-based grab-and go bowls under the ‘Green Street’ banner. “Tyson Foods is transforming from a company with a strong heritage in chicken to a modern food company that is challenging the industry status quo,” said Tom Hayes, who preceded, Noel White as the company’s CEO. “Consumers expect more from food companies today, and we’re up for the challenge. We’re combining our size and scale with agility to make food people want to eat. That’s driving our business and helping us deliver top-tier returns for shareholders.” Hayes spoke about the emergence of alternative protein multiple times in 2017, in various media appearances and interviews, saying that they are becoming increasingly popular. Speaking about Tyson’s investment in Beyond Meat, he said: “One of the things we believe is that protein is going to continue being in demand. And we don’t just think of animal protein. 96 percent of consumers in the US eat animal protein, but any kind of protein. “For us we want to be mindful of that – we are focused on the consumer – and so we have set up a team that focuses on new technology, new food type like Beyond Meat, or could be sustainability technologies, things that get food waste out of the system. So that’s been a big focus for us.” Speaking about the scale of the meat-alternative market he said: “It’s small today – consumers are looking for alternatives – but it’s relatively small. Animal-based meat is still the most efficient way to deliver protein, plant-based is growing though, and there’s a lot of good work being done.” "

Because Animals Inc‘s first product will be a cat treat made from mice. It says the meat will be cultured, without slaughtering any animals. Clean Meat is not a vegan product as it uses animal cells, though some vegans support it because of its potential to reduce animal slaughter. The startup says it is motivated by creating lab-grown meat because it is ‘more humane for farmed animals’. In addition, it says the food will be safer for companion animals. Every year the Food and Drug Administration issues pet food recalls due to chemical and bacterial contamination – associated with factory farming and the use of meat from dead, dying, disabled, or diseased animals. This is not an issue with lab cultivated meat. Fetal Bovine Serum, or FBS, which is controversial as it comes from the blood of a bovine fetus is used to create some lab meat. According to Because Animals Inc, it does not use this ingredient in its products. The company says it has ‘developed a proprietary media that provides the nutrients and growth factors needed for mouse tissue to grow, all without the requirement of FBS’. “What makes this clean meat extra special is that we’ve grown it without any animal ingredients,” Dr. Shannon Falconer, Chief Executive Officer of Because Animals, said in a statement sent to Plant Based News. “At the moment, the standard in the clean meat industry is to grow tissue using serum from another animal – usually fetal bovine serum. “Because Animals is changing that by creating ultra-nutritious foods that provide all the nutritional benefits of traditional animal protein but with animal-free ingredients that protect pets, people and our planet.” "

The retail giant made the comments while it announced its response to this changing customer behavior: to move its vegan range next to meat counters. From today, in 20 Sainsbury’s stores, 26 meat-alternative products including sausages and burgers will be found in the new location. “We were looking at as a business the challenge we face in the future, if we sell less and less meat what do you backfill it with,” James Hamilton, Meat-Free and Ready Meals Buyer at Sainsbury’s, told The Telegraph, adding that the trial was ‘in reaction to a decline in meat sales across the industry’. “So we are supplementing our ranges with alternative proteins and plant-based ranges. We are interested to see what happened. The general market dynamic is that meat is on the decline. “This is a way of giving people more choice and new ideas. People will even if they didn’t buy it will be thinking – is there a different way of doing things. We are appealing to different people than those who shop in our plant based section.” Last year, Hamilton revealed that the supermarket was seeing a surge in consumers opting for plant-based products, with sales of its meat-free range are skyrocketing by a massive 20 percent each week. “We are seeing an increasing interest from our customers in plant-based foods, with sales of our current meat-free range growing 20 percent each week. We’re always exploring new ways to offer even greater choice, quality and value and our new Naturli’ mince and burgers are a brilliant example. “Estimates now put the UK’s number of ‘flexitarians’ – also known as meat-reducers – at around 22 million. It is these consumers who are credited for much of the boom in plant-based sales.” "
5139,Tech Company Creates World’s First Clean Meat Steak,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/tech-company-creates-first-clean-meat-steak/,2018-12-12,"An Israeli tech firm has created the first lab-grown minute steak – made without slaughtering any animals. Lab cultured meat – best known as clean meat – is not vegan, as it currently uses cells from animals. Some scientists also use a bovine growth serum – though there are companies working on making the tech animal-free. Some vegans support clean meat because of its potential to dramatically reduce the number of animals slaughtered. Now Aleph Farms – which does not use an animal-based growth serum – is the first to use this tech to grow steak, nourishing cells and bioreactors in tanks to grow the tissue. It says the steak could be available commercially within two years. “We’re shaping the future of the meat industry – literally,” Didier Toubia, Co-Founder and CEO of Aleph Farms, said in a statement sent to Plant Based News. “Making a patty or a sausage from cells cultured outside the animal is challenging enough, imagine how difficult it is to create a whole-muscle steak. “At Aleph Farms, this is not science fiction. We’ve transformed the vision into reality by growing a steak under controlled conditions. The initial products are still relatively thin, but the technology we developed marks a true breakthrough and a great leap forward in producing a cell-grown steak.”  The company’s breakthrough steak “Aleph Farms’ minute steak is thinly sliced and will cook in just a minute or so,” added Amir Ilan, Chef of the restaurant Paris Texas in Ramat Gan, Israel. “For me, it is a great experience to eat meat that has the look and feel of beef but has been grown without antibiotics and causes no harm to animals or the environment. “Aleph Farms meat has high culinary potential – it can be readily incorporated into top-shelf preparations or served in premium-casual restaurants, trendy cafes, bistros, or other eateries.” Not everyone is happy about the progress of the clean meat lobby. Kay Johnson Smith, President of the Animal Agriculture Alliance, talked about why she has a problem with the product earlier this year. “The Animal Agriculture Alliance supports consumer choice. We’re all about providing products that consumers want consumers want and that they are interested in,” she said. [But the term ‘clean meat’ was] coined by activists who are animal rights activists. They are trying to find alternatives to stop people from eating meat, milk, and eggs. “So this cultured meat, or lab-grown meat is an alternative that they are really pushing and marketing. They know the consumers are kind of ‘icked out’ by cultured meat or meat grown in a lab, so they’ve come up with this term ‘clean meat’ as a way to market it. “The biggest concern is it implies real meat is somehow dirty, or not clean, so it’s very frustrating and from an industry standpoint we need to push back on that, not use that term ourself, and when we’re asked about it, always challenge the fact that it’s called clean meat.” "

Additions in 2018 include plant-based mince and burgers made by Naturli’ Foods – and sold in the meat aisle – alongside the retail giant’s own Love Your Veg! line. According to the supermarket, these products are striking a chord with its customers, with James Hamilton, Plant-Based Buyer at Sainsbury’s, saying: “We are seeing an increasing interest from our customers in plant-based foods, with sales of our current meat-free range growing 20 percent each week.” "
5376,Major International Forum In ‘China’s Silicon Valley’ Will Focus On Plant-Based Meat,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/major-international-forum-china-plant-based-meat/,2018-02-11,"An international forum in Zhongguancun, Beijing – China‘s equivalent of Silicon Valley – will focus on plant-based meat for the first time. The event, which will be held on November 14, will look at how the product can benefit China, as well as how different stakeholders in the country can work together to promote it. Dao Foods International, a cross-border investor that specializes in supporting China-focused ventures in the alternative protein product space, has organized the Forum in collaboration with Dongsheng Science and Technology Park, one of China’s leading accelerator and incubator organizations. This Forum is a key part of the whole-day conference on November 14 with a focus on future agriculture and food. The Forum will bring together representatives of influential international organizations from the plant-based food space to share their experience, perspectives and success cases with a Chinese audience. These organizations include New Crop Capital (U.S.), Good Food Institute (U.S.), Jeremy Coller Foundation (U.K.), ProVeg (Germany), and CP Group (Thailand). New Crop Capital and Jeremy Coller Foundation have invested in leading alternative protein ventures that include Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, Memphis Meats and JUST, and the Good Food Institute has supported hundreds of plant-based and clean meat entrepreneurs. Both New Crop Capital and Good Food Institute are both founding partners in Dao Foods International. At the Forum, the participants will talk about the global excitement and investments in plant-based meat, the importance of reduction of meat consumption to China, how Chinese millennials can be leveraged to mainstream plant-based food, and how various stakeholders can work together to create a viable plant-based food industry. Given the nature of the Forum, international speakers will share their insight and experience primarily from the U.S. and Europe to enlighten future developments of plant-based food in China. A ribbon cutting ceremony and media briefing will also be held during the Forum for Dongsheng-Dao Foods International Next-Generation Food Accelerator, a joint initiative between Dao Foods and Dongsheng to accelerate and invest in China-focused plant-based and potentially clean protein product ventures. A collaborative effort between Dao Ventures, Moonspire Social Ventures, and New Crop Capital, Dao Foods is introducing innovative and climate-friendly protein products, primarily plant-based and clean meat (PBCM), into the Chinese market. This cross-border impact venture aims to disrupt the global meat, egg, and dairy markets in order to curb the environmental impact of meat production and address the health and safety concerns of meat consumption in China. “With rapid rising incomes and increasing meat consumption in China, our aim is to introduce alternative products into the China market to reduce the consumer demand for animal products from the traditional livestock industry, which has had growing negative environmental, food safety and health impact,” said Albert Tseng, co-founder of Dao Foods and Managing Director of Moonspire Social Ventures. “Diets are radically changing in China, and New Crop Capital is proud to be a part of Dao Foods to steer this change in a direction that supports the health of people and the planet,” New Crop Capital’s Chief Investment Officer Chris Kerr says.  “This is a critical moment for China’s food industry, and we at New Crop Capital believe that Dao Foods is equipped to take advantage of this moment to make climate-friendly foods the norms, not the exception.” "
5529,Meat Boss Says Cutting Out Meat Is Not The Answer To Climate Crisis,https://plantbasednews.org/news/meat-boss-cutting-out-meat-not-answer-climate-crisis/,2018-09-10,"A meat industry representative has said he believes cutting out meat is not the answer to the climate crisis. A report published recently by the United Nations said we have 12 years to limit climate change – or suffer major consequences including flooding and heatwaves. The most comprehensive study on food production ever undertaken was published earlier this year – with scientists saying cutting meat and dairy is the most significant step people can take to reduce their impact. But speaking on Sky News, Jago Pearson of Finnebrogue Sausage Manufacturers said he thinks telling people to stop eating meat altogether ‘would be the wrong approach’. “We’ve seen meat eaters having one or two days off, and move to vegetarian or vegan alternatives,” he said. “I don’t. It’s by no means the best option. If you look at maize, if you look at soy*, they have huge environmental impacts as well. “The rest of the meat industry might not thank me for saying this but I do think we need to do more as an industry to cut down on the intensity at which we farm particularly cattle and pigs. He added that the industry is looking at alternative protein sources – including insects and that they must ‘continue to innovate’. “But the idea we say to consumers that actually they should stop eating meat altogether would be the wrong approach. The right approach would be to offer consumer choice and to continue to improve our means of sustainable farming.” While Pearson highlighted the impact of soy production, he didn’t talk about how much of the global soy yield is fed to livestock, and how much soy is therefore consumed by meat eaters. WWF’s 2017 report Appetite for Destruction highlights this, saying: “If the global demand for animal products
grows as anticipated…by 2050, soy
production would need to increase by nearly
80 percent to 390 million tonnes and more than
265 million extra tonnes of maize would be
needed to feed all the animals destined for
our plates.” It adds: “The average European consumes approximately 61kg of soy per year, largely indirectly through the animal products that they eat like chicken, pork, salmon, cheese, milk and eggs.” Representing the other side of the argument was Jasmijn de Boo, International Director at ProVeg, which encourages people to adopt a plant-based diet. “If we look at how cattle are raised it’s mainly rumination, methane, all of these greenhouse gases that are causing the problems,” she said. “It’s also the land clearing to grow feed for livestock, and that often isn’t considered – that when we cut down the forest we contribute to global warming.” de Boo then referenced the UN’s report, pointing out scientists warned that the temperature rise must be kept below 1.5C. “In order to do that we need to cut down on meat and dairy consumption,” she said. “Ideally, the vegan scenario is the best scenario to achieve that.” You can watch the Sky News clip here "
6173,Meat Industry Boss Accuses?’Vegan Activists’ Of Pushing Clean Meat Agenda,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/meat-industry-boss-vegan-activists-clean-meat-agenda/,2018-07-13,"The president of a meat alliance has blasted ‘activist organizations’ for promoting clean and plant-based meat. Clean meat – also known as lab, cultured, or bio meat, is made from animal cells. While it is not vegan, it is supported by a number of vegans because of its potential to lessen the number of animals slaughtered for food. While some manufacturers use foetal bovine serum in the process, some say they will not use it in the products it brings to market. A number of companies are working on bringing a product to market, with many saying 2020 is the goal. JUST plans to bring a product – namely chicken – to market by the end of 2018. Plant-based meat – which is vegan – is simply made from plants. Speaking at an event earlier this year about clean meat – and how it is threatening traditional agriculture – Kay Johnson Smith, President of the Animal Agriculture Alliance, talked about why she has a problem with the term ‘clean meat’, as well as addressing other issues she has with the product.  She said: “The Animal Agriculture Alliance supports consumer choice. We’re all about providing products that consumers want consumers want and that they are interested in.” But she said the meat industry takes issue with the term ‘clean meat’, adding: “This is a term coined by activists who are animal rights activists. They are trying to find alternatives to stop people from eating meat, milk, and eggs. “So this cultured meat, or lab-grown meat is an alternative that they are really pushing and marketing. They know the consumers are kind of ‘icked out’ by cultured meat or meat grown in a lab, so they’ve come up with this term ‘clean meat’ as a way to market it. “The biggest concern is it implies real meat is somehow dirty, or not clean, so it’s very frustrating and from an industry standpoint we need to push back on that, not use that term ourself, and when we’re asked about it, always challenge the fact that it’s called clean meat.” Talking about plant-based meat – for example – the Beyond Burger, she added: “There’s a lot of support from activists organizations, and they’re looking for any way at all to drag people away from eating meat or any protein that comes from animals. We’re about consumer choice so we see plant-based as an ‘and’ proposition rather than an ‘or’ proposition. “We know that we’re going to need to increase the amount of protein we provide in the next 20-30 years, it’s going to have to double, so we see plant-based protein as an alternative – not an alternative but an addition – to real protein that comes from animals. We’re not afraid of it.”  PBN interviews Ethan Brown.Subscribe to PBN’s YouTube Channel here Plant-based meat is currently offering the most competition to traditional animal flesh, with clean meat yet to hit shelves. It has seen its profile rise in both the US and Europe recently, with its products being sold in the meat aisle alongside animal protein. From August, Tesco will be the second British retailer to sell a plant-based product in the meat aisle, with the UK launch of the Beyond Burger. The patty, which will be available in 350 stores across the country, will be sold in two locations instore – alongside traditional animal meat and in the freezer section. Tesco follows supermarket rival Sainsbury’s, which recently launched Naturli’ Foods’ vegan mince and burger products in its meat section. "
6378,US Government Urged To Support Clean Meat,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/clean-meat-company-urges-us-government-back-product/,2018-06-13,"A Tel Aviv-based Clean Meat company is calling on the US Government to promote its product – saying it can improve food safety. Clean meat – also known as lab, cultured, or bio meat, is made from animal cells. While it is not vegan, it is supported by a number of vegans because of its potential to lessen the number of animals slaughtered for food. It is also reportedly more environmentally-friendly than traditional livestock rearing. Now company Aleph Farms is calling on the US Department of Agriculture [USDA] to promote clean meat for its safety advantages over animal flesh, such as being antibiotic free and pathogen free. Aleph Farms’ action follows the US Cattlemen’s Association ([USCA] petitioning the USDA to restrict the terms ‘beef’ and ‘meat’ only to slaughtered animal-based products. The USCA wants the Government to force clean meat producers to differentiate the product from traditional beef. According to the organization: “The labels of ‘beef’ or ‘meat’ should inform consumers that the product is derived naturally from animals as opposed to alternative proteins such as plants and insects or artificially grown in a laboratory. “Alternative products such as those described above should thus not be permitted to be labeled as ‘beef’, which is widely understood by consumers to be the flesh of a bovine animal, such as cattle, harvested for use as food, or as ‘meat’, which is understood to be derived from animal tissue or flesh for use as food.”  Is clean meat ‘ethical’?Subscribe to PBN’s YouTube Channel here Antibiotic resistance is becoming an increasingly serious issue globally, leading to the FDA banning the use of antibiotics solely for animal-growth promotion in 2017. But despite restrictions, the New York Times has reported that 70 – 80 percent of US antibiotic sales go to livestock. “This fact raises public health concerns about increased antibiotic resistance, which causes about 23,000 American deaths a year and $34 billion in financial losses annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC],” says spokesperson for Aleph Farms. The CDC estimates that more than 400,000 United States residents become ill with infections caused by antibiotic-resistant food-borne bacteria every year – and antibiotics may not prevent pathogens in meat. Dr. Neta Lavon, Vice President of R&D at Aleph Farms, said: “Aleph Farms grows antibiotic-free clean meat outside of the animal in a safe, controlled environment, preventing the development of bacteria. Aleph Farms views its advanced 3D cellular agriculture technology as the next step in agricultural practices.” Didier Toubia, Co-Founder and CEO of Aleph Farms, added: “A key USDA role is to minimize consumer exposure to unsafe agricultural products, including meat,. In recent years, the USDA has implemented new proactive policies to reduce pathogens in animal products. “The innovation of clean meat is a natural development in line with USDA policies to reduce exposure to pathogens. Most meat is contaminated during the slaughter process, and clean meat eliminates this risk.” It has been suggested that farmers are backing a ban on labeling clean meat ‘meat’, in a bid to quash the increasing threat posed by these tech companies. But Toubia says: “We understand this is a sensitive issue for the cattlemen, but at Aleph Farms, we see the introduction of clean meat as an industry-wide opportunity, rather than a threat. We are not looking to replace farmed meat, but rather to offer an additional choice to the consumer.” “Aleph Farms has tremendous respect for hardworking cattle farmers; my wife is a farmer, too. The farmers’ role is to feed the world, so they should be willing to embrace new food production technologies.” "

The move comes amid advancements being made in the clean meat field – with high tech companies – including Memphis Meats and Just – vowing to have products on shelves within two years. Companies like these have secured large amounts of funding from high profile investors – and have suggested they will disrupt the traditional face of meat production. Clean meat – known as lab, bio, or cultured meat – is built using animal cells.

Clean meat – also known as lab, bio, or cultured meat – is built using animal cells. It is therefore not vegan, though some vegans choose to support the concept, as it has the potential to reduce the number of animals slaughtered for food. It is also a more environmentally friendly option than traditional livestock farming. Plant-based meat doesn’t involve any cells, and is made entirely from plants. Bruce Friedrich is the Executive Director of the Good Food Institute [GFI] – a nonprofit organization that promotes innovative alternatives to conventional meat, dairy products, and eggs. During a recent TEDx talk, Friedrich talked about issues around meat production. Friedrich started his talk by giving a plate of pasta to an audience member, then throwing eight plates into a bin bag, as the audience gasped. He said: “Throwing away food is a horrible idea. “And yet that’s basically the relationship all of us enter into, every time we choose to eat meat. “Because a chicken – just one example – it takes nine calories into a chicken, in the form of soy, and oats, and wheat and whatever the food is that’s fed to the chicken – to get one calorie back out.”  The TEDx talk According to Friedrich, of every 100 calories of food we produce, we throw away 40. He says: “And yet food that’s produced by funnelling crops through chickens, it’s actually 800 percent food waste. “For every 100 calories of chicken we produce – and chicken is the most efficient meat – we throw away 800 calories by cycling it through the chicken.” He adds: “That means eight times as much land, eight times as much water, eight times as much gasoline to till the crops, eight times as much pesticide dumped onto crops. “And that’s not all of it – there are also multiple extra stages of production required if we’re to grow crops to feed them to animals so we can eat animals.” He explains that you have to grow the crops and ship them on a gas-guzzling, pollution-spewing vehicle to a feed mill, and you operate the feed mill. “And then you ship the feed on a gas-guzzling, pollution-spewing vehicle to an industrial farm, and you operate that farm, and you ship the animals to a slaughterhouse, and you operate that slaughterhouse. Multiple extra stages – it’s not a great way to feed 9.8 billion people by 2050.”  PBN interviews Beyond Meat Founder Ethan Brown Friedrich cites Beyond Meat Founder Ethan Brown as a pioneer in the plant-based meat movement. He says: “It occurs to him that meat is made from lipids, amino acids, minerals, and water – everything in animal-based meat also exists in plants. “So Brown’s plan is to make meat from plants…after about three years he comes out with a plant-based chicken, which Bill Gates describes as ‘the future of food’.” He also references Impossible Foods Founder Pat Brown – who created the Impossible Burger in an attempt to stave off the impending climate crisis. “And boy is it fantastic,” Friedrich claims. The third pioneer he mentions is Uma Valeti – Founder of Memphis Meat. Considered a leader in the field, the brand plans to bring clean meat to the mass market by 2020. “Clean meat is cleaner,” says Friedrich. “There is no slaughterhouse, there are no antibiotics.”  Check out PBN’s taste test between the Impossible Burger and Beyond Burger Friedrich says he’s convinced that in the ‘not too distant future’, the idea of growing massive quantities of crops, to funnel them through animals, so we can eat meat, will be seen as absurd. “Visionaries have understood that we can make meat from plants, and we can grow meat without all of the inefficiencies and without all the pollution,” he says. “Markets and food technology are going to save the world.” You canwatch the video on YouTube here "

Justin Whitmore, Executive Vice President Corporate Strategy and Chief Sustainability Officer of Tyson Foods, said: “We’re excited about this opportunity to broaden our exposure to innovative, new ways of producing meat, especially since global protein demand has been increasing at a steady rate. “We continue to invest significantly in our traditional meat business, but also believe in exploring additional opportunities for growth that give consumers more choices.” Uma Valeti, M.D., Co-founder and CEO of Memphis Meats, added: “We are excited that Tyson Foods will be joining us in our mission to bring meat to the table in a sustainable, affordable and delicious way. “Our vision is for the world to eat what it loves, in a way that addresses today’s challenges for the environment, animal welfare and public health. “We are accelerating our work and building out a world-class team to make this a reality.” Memphis Meats expects to use the funds to speed up product development. The company is currently recruiting to expand its team of chefs, scientists, creative people and business people. Tyson joins a raft of investors including Bill Gates and Richard Branson. "
7359,Clean Meat Future Described as ‘Inevitable’,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/clean-meat-future-described-as-inevitable/,2018-01-24,"Major news outlet Fast Company has described our ‘clean meat future’ as ‘radical – but inevitable’. An article by writer Eillie Anzilotti looks at Paul Shapiro’s (of the Humane Society) book Clean Meat: How Eating Meat Without Animals Will Revolutionize Dinner and the World – which details the processes around, and the arguments for, clean meat. Clean meat – also known as lab, bio, or cultured meat – is built using animal cells. It is therefore not vegan, though some vegans choose to support the concept, as it has the potential to reduce the number of animals slaughtered for food. It is also a more environmentally-friendly option than traditional livestock farming. According to Shapiro, we are reaching what he describes as ‘peak meat’. He argues that it will be impossible to feed billions of people through ‘large-scale animal agriculture’ because of the environmental impact of farming – which is one of the key drivers of climate change. It is also highly wasteful, requiring huge amounts of water and land. In addition, crops grown to feed livestock would go much further if given directly to humans.  Shapiro says: “So we’re at the point where we can try to persuade people in the United States to voluntarily eat less meat, which is a good idea, but we can also try to produce meat with fewer resources. “It’s kind of like how you can try to get people to turn off their light bulbs more, but you can also invent a light bulb that’s so energy efficient that it wouldn’t even matter if they left it on.” According to Anzilotti, the environmental payoff of clean meat is potentially huge: “Clean meat is the kerosene to factory farming’s whale oil. “And arguably, it places much less of a relative drain on natural resources, as extracting petroleum still causes harm to the environment. “While producing one pound of beef requires around 1,799 gallons of water, the Impossible Burger–the eerily meat-like substitute derived entirely from plant-based materials–uses 75% less water and generates 87% fewer greenhouse gases than traditional livestock agriculture. “Memphis Meats, which is focused on growing chicken products (and other meats) through cell culture, claims that once the process scales, it will require significantly less water than poultry farms.” "
7374,OPINION: Februdairy Means The Farmers Are Fighting Back,https://plantbasednews.org/opinion/opinion-februdairy-farmers-fighting-back/,2018-01-22,"Veganuary. Movember. Decembeard. Go Sober For October. The 2018 calendar is jam-packed with months that mean something to fundraisers and social justice defenders everywhere. But there’s a new kid on the block this year. Februdairy. The phrase was coined by farmers and launched last year, but it didn’t get the traction expected. In February 2018 they’re at it again, only this time the vegan community is all over it. Februdairy is described as ‘a chance for everyone to be grateful for our special relationship with cows’. That special relationship being the one in which we impregnate the cow, take its baby, sell its milk and then send it to slaughter when it isn’t profitable for us anymore. Special indeed. Februdairy is part of a growing resistance to veganism. This year will also see the launch of a £1.2 million advertising campaign to promote the benefits of the white stuff. It’s being described as a chance to ‘re-establish’ credentials and ‘celebrate dairy’.  Dairy is facing stiff competition from plant-based milks This announcement comes less than a year after the Advertising Standards Authority rejected complaints that an advert describing dairy farming as inhumane was misleading. Advertising bosses allowed Go Vegan World to declare: “Humane Milk Is A Myth.” Whoever thought we would see the day when that would happen? It feels as though we’re finally winning this nonviolent battle. Whilst meat and fish counters are closing across the country, sales of plant-based alternatives are up by as much as 25 percent. The global meat market is being warned to ‘wake up’ by industry experts, as it’s losing ground to the alternative protein sector. More people than ever before are ditching dead animals and opting for the vegan options most supermarkets and restaurants seem suddenly so eager to provide. But more telling than anything else is the farming industry’s reaction to what vegans are doing. The industry has never felt as though it has to defend its practices before.  Suddenly it does. Februdairy is the perfect opportunity for vegans to put cows front and centre. Most people can understand why a person might not want to eat meat, but avoiding taking milk from a cow is almost incomprehensible to those who are willing to actually eat an animal. When you’re living with a general population who can’t see what’s wrong with engineering the birth and growth of an animal with the same level of intelligence as a three-year-old child just so that s/he can be killed and turned into bacon, how are you ever going to convince them that it isn’t ok to take milk from one? Luckily activists recognize this.  More people are learning about the ethical issues around dairy We’re reasonably far from February yet, but the Februdairy Twitter hashtag is already bursting with vegans and the things they have to say. There’s an official vegan Facebook page and activists up and down the country are frantically pulling together memes, gifs and infographics depicting what it really means to take milk from a cow. In Newcastle, the Northern Animal Welfare Cooperative has planned dairy-specific outreach activities, where organizer John Lord says they’ll be highlighting the poor nutritional aspects of dairy to the public. He adds: “We’ll also be talking about the inherent cruelty in the dairy industry.” Doesn’t the saying go ‘first they laugh, then they fight you, then you win’? Well it seems the farming industry doesn’t find us funny anymore. It’s finally recognizing that we mean real business here. We’re worthy of an advertising campaign to counteract our actions. We’re inspiring farm-focused hashtags. Last year an industry writer was quoted as saying that the ‘assault by demon vegans‘ is one of the major challenges facing farmers in 2018. The article rightly pointed out that we’re still out here; smarter, more determined and better financed than we have ever been before. We need to keep doing what we’re doing because it’s working. The stickering, protesting and Facebook posts. The liking, sharing and standing in a cube with a mask on. The endless trudging up and down city streets. The vigils. It’s all making the difference we want it to make. Februdairy is just another indication of this. The farmers are fighting back – and that is something we should all be incredibly happy about. "
7404,‘Clean Meat’ To Launch In Restaurants ‘Within 2 Years’,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/clean-meat-products-launch-restaurants-2-years/,2018-01-18,"Food tech company Mosa Meat has announced it will be debuting its ‘clean meat’ products in high-end restaurants within two years. Clean meat – also known as lab, bio, or cultured meat – is built using animal cells. It is therefore not vegan, though some vegans choose to support the concept, as it has the potential to reduce the number of animals slaughtered for food. It is also a more environmentally-friendly option than traditional livestock farming.  Do you support lab grown meat? Mosa Meat, which is based in Maastricht in the Netherlands, launched the world’s first clean meat burger in 2013. Made of muscle fiber, and produced ‘without killing an animal’, the patty had the texture, but not the flavor or color of meat. Mosa Meat has since then been working on creating food-grade fat tissue and heme, the iron-containing molecule that is responsible for the taste, aroma, and color of meat – and aims to introduce ‘Burger 2.0’ to high-end eateries by 2020. Once ‘Burger 2.0’ reaches ‘an extremely premium, but sellable price’, it will be featured on the menus of upscale restaurants – which according to Mosa Meat’s Chief Executive Officer Peter Verstrate, ‘will be a statement, not a commercial venture’. “We’re 70 to 80 percent there,” Verstrate told industry outlet FoodNavigator. The food tech firm has been focusing on the least sustainable source of food in terms of methane emissions, land impact, feed requirements, and energy conversion – beef. The Chief Executive Officer also mentioned he wants to grow meat from a culture medium that isn’t based on bovine serum. “We want to be ethical and to be able to call the product vegetarian. “[Bovine] serum is the least animal-friendly product in the world, it’s extracted from unborn calves. We definitely won’t go to market with that in it.” Speaking about competitors (such as Memphis Meats, SuperMeat, and Hampton Creek which are all developing lab-grown meat), Verstrate explained that the sooner clean meat products hit the market the better, regardless of who launches it first. “We are mainly driven by desire to solve a problem – meat production getting out of hand. “If there’s a breakthrough in the US or Israel before us, it will at least be a good starting point. I personally would be fine with that. “The value of market for meat globally is more than one trillion dollars. Four companies in a shared field is not an issue.” Mosa Meat recently received funding from ‘a group of mission-driven investors from the US’, and it also expects to close a second, larger round of funding by the end of the quarter from the pharmaceutical and food industries. “These are real strategic investors who like what we do because they think it might be part of their future,” Verstrate said.

7557,Major Poultry Producer Teams Up With Clean Meat Startup,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/major-poultry-producer-clean-meat-startup/,2018-02-01,"Israeli biotech and food-tech startup SuperMeat has raised $3 million in seed funding and has formed a ‘strategic partnership’ with PHW, one of Europe’s largest poultry producers, and an equity investor in the company. Clean meat, which is grown in a lab, is a contentious issue. While it isn’t a vegan product, as it relies on using animal cells, many see it as an ethically and environmentally preferable option to tradition livestock farming. With the recently secured funding, the Tel-Aviv-based company expects to bring its clean chicken products to market within three years, at a price point similar to the conventional chicken products currently available on store shelves.  US-based venture capital fund New Crop Capital led the recent seed round, along with mission-oriented VC firm Stray Dog Capital.  Both firms are openly committed to investing in more sustainable food systems, and have previously backed big names in the alternative protein field such as Beyond Meat and SunFed.  This new round of funding follows a crowdfunding campaign which raised $230,000 in pre-orders for SuperMeat’s clean meat products.  According to a spokesperson: “SuperMeat’s clean meat is produced by growing cells that have been painlessly extracted from a chicken.  “The cells are then grown in conditions that allow them to thrive, forming high-quality chicken cuts.  “This process puts an end to the industrial need to mass produce animals for slaughter, while eliminating exposure to animal waste and food-borne illnesses; the potential benefits for public health and animal welfare are therefore considerable.  “At the same time, clean meat is also highly beneficial for the environment, with drastically reduced carbon and ecological footprints compared to current meat production methods.  “According to research conducted by Oxford and Amsterdam Universities, switching to clean meat will allow a reduction of up to 98 percent in greenhouse gas emissions, 99 percent in land exploitation, and up to 96 percent in water usage.”  The ethics of lab meat ?Commenting on the new partnership with SuperMeat, PHW-Gruppe’s CEO Peter Wesjohann said: “We at PHW have time and again left the beaten path in conducting our business.  “This approach not only facilitates the development of best-in-class animal welfare concepts in our core poultry business, but will also lead to the strengthening of our vegan product portfolio, confirming our leading role in the global consumer trend towards a cleaner, more protein-rich diet. ?”The equity investment in SuperMeat is evidence of our forward-thinking strategy. SuperMeat is consistent with our pursuit to provide Europe with sustainable, clean foods– we do not see this transaction as a financial investment but rather as the beginning of a long-term strategic partnership. ?”We look forward to working together with SuperMeat and are committed to supporting the company in its research and development, as well as the strategic positioning of its products in the European market.  “Our R&D, marketing and distribution expertise will contribute to the success of this exciting and promising company – thereby contributing to the development of cultured meat.”  SuperMeat’s crowdfunding campaign ?Ido Savir, Co-founder and CEO of SuperMeat, said: “We’re proud that SuperMeat is at the forefront of the rapidly-evolving clean meat industry. “Our team is comprised of a diverse group of top-tier scientists, food engineers and chefs, working together with the best production experts from the pharmaceutical industry to create a new generation of meat products that are sustainable, cost-efficient, animal-friendly, and of course – delicious.  “We are proud to partner with a top-tier meat producer like PHW; this partnership will enable us to bring to market a revolutionary new generation of tasty, sustainable meat products throughout Europe and beyond.” "
7647,Meat Giant Tyson CEO On Beyond Meat Investment: ‘If You Can’t Beat Em – Join Em’,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/tyson-ceo-beyond-meat-if-you-cant-beat-em-join-em/,2017-12-20," The boss of the world’s largest meat processing company has spoken about how plant-based proteins are becoming increasingly popular a number of times this year. Tyson President and CEO Tom Hayes has appeared on radio shows and on panels talking about the future of alternative proteins. Earlier this year, he spoke to Fortune’s Beth Kowitt about the future of ‘alternative proteins’ – as well as why the company has invested in plant-based tech startup Beyond Meat. Talking about the investment, host Beth Kowitt says: “You have invested in a protein alternative company. “It seems like that company wants to totally destroy your business. “So why are you investing in it?”  PBN interviews Beyond Meat Founder Ethan Brown Hayes replies: “If you can’t beat em, join em, right? “It’s not that they want to completely destroy us – the company is Beyond Meat. “One of the things we believe is that protein is going to continue being in demand. “And we don’t just think of animal protein. 96 percent of consumers in the US eat animal protein, but any kind of protein.” Hayes says protein could be ‘vegetable-based or any kind of emerging protein’. He adds: “For us we want to be mindful of that – we are focused on the consumer – and so we have set up a team that focuses on new technology, new food type like Beyond Meat, or could be sustainability technologies, things that get food waste out of the system. “So that’s been a big focus for us.  “The first investment has been Beyond Meat but we’re looking for other investments that will being us up the curve in terms of sustainability and production at scale.”  Leonardo DiCaprio has also invested in Beyond Meat Kowitt asks Hayes how big he thinks the meat-alternative market is going to be. Hayes says: “It’s small today – consumers are looking for alternatives – but it’s relatively small. “Animal-based meat is still the most efficient way to deliver protein, plant-based is growing though, and there’s a lot of good work being done.” "
7750,BREAKING: Meat Giant Tyson Increases Stake In Plant Based Beyond Meat,https://plantbasednews.org/news/tyson-increases-stake-plant-based-beyond-meat/,2017-08-12,"Meat processing company Tyson Foods has increased its stake in plant-based company Beyond Meat. Tyson first acquired a five percent stake last year: as yet the details of the new purchase have not been released, though the company said it took part in Beyond Meat’s most recent funding round through its venture capital fund. The company is reportedly looking to tap into the growing alternative protein market.  Hollywood heavyweight Leonardo DiCaprio has invested in Beyond Meat According to a recent report, the meat will have to look at diversifying if it is to keep hold of its market share. The report, called Watch out… or They Will Steal Your Growth! Why Alternative Proteins Are Competing So Successfully for the Centre of the Plate, says that ‘doing nothing’ is not a rational response to the threat posed by alternative proteins. It says: “Alternative proteins are capturing plenty of consumer interest, food column inches, and space in food retail cabinets and on foodservice menus.  “And if the talk is any indicator, they appear set to enter the mainstream in the coming years.” Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown faced some criticism after Tyson Foods bought its first stake in the company. Talking at the time, Brown said: “Do I think Tyson and its executives are the enemy because they have a radically different view of our relationship to animals? I don’t.  “The good news is that Tyson and I can – and do – agree on many other things including: the need for sustainable protein for a growing global population; that innovation can fuel growth and profit; and that business best serves the consumer by offering choice.” Pizza Hut To ‘Okja’: 9 Moments That Showed Veganism Is Going Mainstream Demand Leads Supermarket Tesco To Double Vegan And Veggie Christmas Food Vegan Documentary ‘What The Health’ Nominated For Major Award "

The report puts the massive growth down to the rise of flexitarian diets, as well as changing consumer habits. Informa says these changes have been inspired by concerns around ‘health, animal welfare, and the environmental impact’ of eating animal foods. UK plant milk sales totalled $280 million in 2016 – and are expected to rise to $400 million by 2021. In the same time period, dairy milk sales are predicted to see a rise of just 5.2 percent. Globally, the sector is expected to grown by 43 percent in the US, 47 percent in Australia and 19 percent in China – where the market is already much bigger. Informa’s Agribusiness Intelligence Special Reports and Projects director Alan Bullion said: “As consumers in the UK and around the world begin making tentative steps away from milk and meat due to animal welfare, environmental, or health concerns, we’re expecting to see continuing strong growth in sales of alternative protein products. “While milk and meat alternatives are still a long way from impacting on the massive global meat and milk markets, they will continue to capture a slice of the growing worldwide protein market.” Demand Leads Supermarket Tesco To Double Vegan And Veggie Christmas Food Vegan Documentary ‘What The Health’ Nominated For Major Award Former Food Marketing Exec Explains How The Media Makes Us Eat Animals "
7770,Startup Plans To Make ‘Clean Meat’ To Feed Companion Animals,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/startup-clean-meat-feed-companion-animals/,2017-05-12,"A food tech startup wants to grown ‘clean meat’ to feed cats and dogs. Clean meat – also known as lab, bio, or cultured meat – fiercely splits opinion. It is not vegan, as it relies on using animal starter cells. Some manufacturers (not all) also use bovine serum. But while some dislike the technology, others see it as a positive step forward. A number of companies have been working on bringing lab meat to market for human consumption, with Just (formerly Hampton Creek) pledging to have the product on shelves by 2018, and Memphis Meats saying it will be available in 2020. The version for companion animals could be in shops in the next couple of years. Colorado-based Bond Pets says it wants to make ‘pet food made from real animal protein without the animals’. According to Founder Rich Kelleman, he and his wife were unable to find food for their companion animals that was healthy and clearly labeled. He said: “The sourcing of meat proteins is opaque. When we found boutique options that were out there, the science was suspect.” Kelleman sees his product as a solution to numerous issues, saying that under lab conditions, food can be specifically tailored to meet the requirements of specific breeds. He added: “I think the other benefit to approaching it and making food in this way…is that we can also potentially mitigate a lot of the safety issues that plague the industry right now. “When you look at the tremendous number of recalls through the years, certainly a lot of meat proteins are the culprits of a lot of food safety issues.” Although cultured meat is not (yet) vegan – it does offer some sustainability benefits over traditionally reared meat. Pet food industry consultant Ryan Yamka told Quartz: “Pet food has always been quick follower to the human food trends. “So it’s not surprising that you see…what I would call the sustainable- food movement getting into the pet-food side.” OPINION: How ‘Bacongate’ Inspired My New Vegan Advocacy Style Demand Leads Supermarket Tesco To Double Vegan And Veggie Christmas Food James Cameron: ‘We Need Less Meat And Dairy – And More Plant Based Options’ "
7796,Vegan Brand Field Roast Sells To Meat Industry Giant For $120M: Good News Or Bad?,https://plantbasednews.org/opinion/vegan-brand-field-roast-sells-to-meat-industry-giant-for-120m-good-news-or-bad/,2017-02-12,"Canadian meat processing giant Maple Leaf Foods has acquired vegan brand Field Roast Grain Meat Co for $120 million dollars. Washington-based Field Roast, which was founded in 1997 and employs approximately 200 people, creates grain-based ‘meat’ and vegan cheese products – with sales of approximately $38 million.  It is the second meatless brand Maple Leaf Foods – which employs over 11,000 people across North America and has been described as ‘Canada’s largest meat processor’ – has bought this year.  In February, it invested $140 million snapping up veggie company Lightlife. According to Maple Leaf Foods President and CEO Michael McCain, while the company wants to expand its offering, it wants to do so in a socially conscious way. He said: “The acquisition of Field Roast complements and expands our portfolio in the fast-growing North American market for alternative proteins. “It also aligns with our vision to be a leader in sustainable protein and create shared value through making a positive social impact.  “Field Roast has built brand leadership through focusing on quality, craftsmanship and taste, and its acquisition will allow Maple Leaf to fuel growth in the category through investment, brand building and innovation.” But when a company that has built itself on the commodification of animals acquires one with vegan values, it comes with a certain level of controversy, and tends to spark debate within the plant-based and vegan communities. This was evident earlier this summer: the acquisition of vegan cheese company Daiya by Otsuka Pharmaceutical caused huge debate when consumers learned that Otsuka tests on animals. With such disparate values, many decided to boycott Daiya’s products, choosing to invest their money into companies with ethics more aligned with their own. Plant-based company Beyond Meat also faced scrutiny in October last year when meat processing giant Tyson bought a five percent stake in the company for an undisclosed fee. Writing at the time, CEO Ethan Brown said he accepted that the news would be problematic for some consumers, saying: “My willingness to engage with Tyson may unsettle the most ardent supporters of our brand.  “Tyson will also likely hear disapproval from certain stakeholders, suppliers, and consumers.  “Yet in both cases, I like to think that our nascent relationship is a hopeful sign. A sign that we may be moving…toward productive collaboration that expands consumer choice.” While investing this kind of money into plant-based brands is surely a smart business decision for the likes of Maple Leaf, Otsuka, and Tyson Foods, it can create questions for ethically-motivated shoppers. Some consumers are uneasy knowing they are now, by proxy, supporting a non-vegan company if they continue to buy products from companies like Field Roast. It may at times be difficult to stomach the idea that Maple Leaf and Tyson are the same companies that have historically exploited animals for profit.  However, it may be better to see events such as these as wins, and signs of massive progress, for the animals – given what the vegan movement is up against.  Investment from bigger corporations could translate into improved marketability, reach, and overall success for plant-based products. In addition, maybe the ethics of the smaller brands could start to rub off on their new, less ethical parent companies? Field Roast CEO David Lee said: “One thing is for certain – we are as committed as ever to the vegan movement, keeping our products vegan, and creating a more beautiful and peaceful world to live in.” It’s undeniable that the market is changing, as is the discourse around food in North America and beyond.  This investment may very well be a beacon of hope.

7837,Report Calls On Meat Industry To ‘Wake Up’ As Plant Based Alternatives Skyrocket,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/meat-industry-wake-up-plant-based-alternatives-skyrocket/,2017-11-27,"The meat industry has to ‘wake-up’ if it is to stop plant-based alternatives from ‘stealing’ its market share, according to a new report. The report, called Watch out… or They Will Steal Your Growth! Why Alternative Proteins Are Competing So Successfully for the Centre of the Plate, says that ‘doing nothing’ is not a rational response to the threat posed by alternative proteins. It says: “Alternative proteins are capturing plenty of consumer interest, food column inches, and space in food retail cabinets and on foodservice menus.  “And if the talk is any indicator, they appear set to enter the mainstream in the coming years.” The study, by Rabo Research, claims that the growth of alternative proteins is of greater interest than their current market size. Justin Sherrard, Global Strategist – Animal Protein, says: “The strong and persistent drivers supporting the current growth of alternative proteins will continue over the next five years, at least. “This means alternative proteins have the potential to capture a material share of animal protein demand growth in the EU, and also capture more market share in the US and Canada.” The meat industry should look at opportunities within the alternative proteins sector, according to the report, which says: “This growth should also serve as a wake-up call to the animal protein sector, as we do not see doing nothing as a rational response.  “The persistent drivers behind the growth in alternative proteins offer clear opportunities—and if animal protein companies do not seize these, they will turn into threats. “These opportunities include investing in developing alternative protein sources, in addition to learning from the companies already active in this space about product innovation, positioning, and marketing.” Some meat processors have already put out feelers into the alternatives sector. Tom Hayes CEO, Tyson Foods – one of the largest meat processors in the world – said: “Plant-based protein is growing almost, at this point, a little faster than animal-based, so I think the migration may continue in that direction.” The company has already bought a five percent stake in plant-based meat producer Beyond Meat (for an undisclosed amount). Additionally, a number of global meat producers are rumored to be in talks with plant food tech startup Just over potentially licensing lab meat technology. While lab meat is not vegan – it is viewed as an alternative to the traditional rearing and using of animals.

7838,IN PICTURES: 2017 The Year Veganism Went Mainstream,https://plantbasednews.org/opinion/2017-the-year-veganism-went-mainstream/,2017-11-27," This year has seen incredible strides forward in the vegan movement – with more people choosing the lifestyle. Large brands have started to sit up and take notice of the increasing demand for plant-based products. The word ‘vegan’ is used more and more in the mainstream media, and animal agriculture is starting to look at how the movement will damage its bottom line. Here are some of the biggest vegan moments from the year – all taken from PBN’s much-anticipated new film, Vegan 2017. No-one could have predicted the success this initiative would have in its very first year. World Plant Milk Day was featured in the mainstream media and even provoked a response campaign from the National Farmer’s Union [NFU]. The NFU’s ‘Proud of Dairy’ hashtag got a few mentions on social media, by contrast, World Plant Milk Day trended for hours – a metaphor for the state of the two industries? Back in July, an advert for fried chicken chain KFC fiercely divided viewers – leaving many outraged at its depiction of a dancing chicken. The ad shows a healthy, clean white chicken dancing around an airy spacious space to DMX’s X Gon’ Give It To Ya. The aim is to show viewers that when they eat KFC, they are eating ‘100 per cent’ chicken. But critics claimed the ad backfired in this plan badly, by highlighting chickens as sentient animals, and putting people off eating them. Some meat eaters reacted to the advert by saying ‘they don’t want to be reminded they are eating an animal’. Megan Winton said: “Is it just me who thinks the new KFC ad is wrong?  “They’re pretty much showing off the happy chickens they’re essentially going to slaughter.” Anita Krajnc, an activist with Toronto Pig Save, was charged with ‘mischief’ after giving water to thirsty pigs on their way to slaughter in 2015. In May, the charges were dropped, in a move campaigners labeled a ‘victory for compassion’. Krajnc, who previously said it was ‘shocking’ that she was charged for giving water to thirsty pigs, paraphrased ex-Beatle and vegetarian Paul McCartney in court.  She said: “If slaughterhouses had glass walls, everyone would be vegan and animal activists.” ? Former world champion free runner Tim Shieff was just one of the panelists on a BBC News show which focused on the rise of veganism. The program was just one of many produced by the mainstream media this year. According to the presenter Chloe Tilley, one in five Brits would now consider a vegan diet – and there are more than half a million vegans in Great Britain. “So,” she asked, “should we all be going vegan?” This year saw the meat industry face up to the growth of the alternative protein market – and what that could mean for business. A report said the meat industry has to ‘wake-up’ if it is to stop plant-based alternatives from ‘stealing’ its market share, claiming: “Alternative proteins are capturing plenty of consumer interest, food column inches, and space in food retail cabinets and on foodservice menus. “And if the talk is any indicator, they appear set to enter the mainstream in the coming years.” Some meat processors have already put out feelers into the alternatives sector. Cargill, one of the largest food brands in the world, sold off its feedlots to invest the money in plant-based protein. Additionally, Tom Hayes CEO, Tyson Foods – one of the largest meat processors in the world – said: “Plant-based protein is growing almost, at this point, a little faster than animal-based, so I think the migration may continue in that direction.” Comedian and vegan Simon Amstell created this full length film, which was released on BBC 3 in March. Amstell announced the news somewhat sheepishly, saying: “I have written and directed a film about veganism. I’m sorry” But the film garnered wide praise – with one critic calling it ‘the vegan comedy that’s actually funny’. After animal rights charity Viva! obtained grim undercover footage of Hogwood Farm in Warwickshire – including pigs eating the rotting corpses of dead pigs who had not been removed – thousands of people signed a petition asking Tesco to drop the farm as a supplier. While the conditions themselves highlighted huge problems within British farming, the mainstream media coverage as well as public reaction, showed people are starting to care about animal suffering on a wide scale. Actor and comedian Craig Robinson was just one of many high profile celebs ditching animal products this year. Talking on Harry Connick Jr.’s talk show Harry, the celeb said that eating plant-based was ‘so much easier than [he] thought it would be’. He said: “I haven’t been drinking, since January I just put down the alcohol I was going to detox…I had heard, I don’t know how true it is, but I heard you can regenerate your liver in six months.  “I was like let me see if I can go six months and I just haven’t gone back and then working out, and I’ve been trying this vegan lifestyle too. “I lost a bunch of weight. I lost 50 pounds.” Earlier this year dairy bosses admitted that the industry is ‘facing an existential crisis’ due to vegan campaigning. This ad campaign by Irish Dairy – in which cow’s milk was described as ‘plant-based’ – appeared to be a conscious attempt to fight the plant-based message. On Irish Dairy – The Complete Natural’s Facebook page, the poster image was met with negativity. User Daniel Gould posted an image of various plant milks, saying: “They taste a hell of a lot better too. Must be the lack of pus in the glass and blood on my hands.” Tawnie Ocampo added: “False advertisement! How dare you call cow’s milk natural and plant based. “I hope you get sued.” Breastfeeding mother Jessica Strathdee ended up ditching her job as a dairy worker after witnessing ‘routine cruelty to baby animals’. Strathdee says she could no longer stand by and watch mothers separated from their children, or baby calves screaming to their slaughterhouse deaths. Now she has done a full 180 – and become a proud animal rescuer and activist. Strathdee (and her partner) now regularly speak out about the cruelty of New Zealand dairy.  In October, Dairy giant DanoneWave announced plans to invest a staggering $60 million into its plant-based milk production operation in Virginia. Dan Poland, chief supply chain officer for DanoneWave, said: “Our success as a business is integrally linked to the ecosystem in which we operate, and we are grateful to Virginia, the governor, his extended team, and everyone in Rockingham county for being so encouraging and for providing such a productive environment. “With the support of our employees, business partners and the community at large, including the Commonwealth, we are able to provide better-for-you food and beverage choices.” This year has seen supermarkets really start to tap into the growing vegan market – with retail giant Tesco taking the exciting step of appointing a Director of Plant Based Innovation – Derek Sarno. Sarno has indicated that choice for vegans in-store is set to grow in the coming months, saying at a recent event: “It’s unavoidable, it’s just going to happen – whether you’re in the way and get run over, or are part of the ride. “This next year – 2018 – is our year. It’s the year veganism goes mainstream.” As far back as 2016, tech leaders were calling plant food a leader in tech – but this year has seen the industry skyrocket. Plant-based alternative like the Beyond Burger and Impossible Burgers have become more widely available (with the Beyond Burger set to hit the UK in 2018). ‘Clean meat’ – meat grown in a lab (which is not vegan, but would see less animals killed and less dangerous emissions) – has also seen progress, with companies saying it could become available as soon as 2018. While in the UK, the BBC was hosting all-vegan panels, across the pond in the US, popular television host Wendy Williams spoke to plant-based Dr. Oz about plant-based diets. “I recently turned 51, I have never felt better, fitter, or stronger in my life. “I lost 50lb. I concentrated and did it slowly but surely. Recently me and my husband and son went vegan with an alkaline twist. “I don’t eat meat anymore – it’s been life changing.” Back in September, animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere [DXE] accused the FBI of ‘intimidating vegan activists’ – in a story that was picked up by a number of mainstream outlets. According to [DxE], FBI agents in bulletproof vests descended on two shelters for abandoned farm animals – Ching Farm Rescue in Herriman, Utah and Luvin Arms in Erie, Colorado. The group claims the agents had search warrants, and demanded DNA samples for two dying piglets activists had recently taken from a Smithfield farm in Utah. DXE says the FBI’s raids are ‘intended to intimidate activists who are engaged in rescue and whistleblowing efforts’. An email from an FBI spokeswoman to The Washington Post didn’t shine much light on the case. It said: “I can say that we were at the two locations conducting court-authorized activity related to an ongoing investigation. “Because it’s ongoing, I’m not able to provide any more details at this time.” The UK saw one of its biggest ever animal rights marches in September, when thousands of activists from around the world marched together in solidarity as part of the second annual Official Animal Rights March. As part of the global action, more than 5,000 people in London marched on Parliament in a bid to end animal exploitation. Activists also took to the streets in New York, Los Angeles, Miami, and Romania. Ed Winters, co-founder of campaign group Surge, which coordinated the event, said: “To see this many vegans take to the streets is a humbling sign of the changing attitudes society is having towards the treatment of non-human animals. “As vegans, we stand against all forms of oppression, with no exceptions defined by species. It is time for society to understand that the life of an animal is worth far more than our taste buds.” This summer, celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck wrote about the rising popularity of veganism – and how he is enjoying creating delicious dishes free from animal products. Writing in Twin Cities he said: “With veganism gaining an ever-higher profile, it’s only natural that my chefs and I get more and more frequent requests for vegan dishes.  “Now, you might think that we’d find it challenging to prepare delicious, even luxurious-tasting food following such restrictions. “But, in fact, more and more products are widely available that make vegan cooking not only possible but actually a pleasure.” This year certainly started with a bang for veganism – when retail giant Sainsbury’s revealed that sales of its new cheese range (known affectionately as ‘Gary’) had surpassed sales expectations by a staggering 300 percent. Speaking about the vegan boom in sales at the time, VegfestUK organiser Tim Barford said: “The growth in the vegan trade [in the UK] has been astronomical. “We now need a dedicated trade event where only trade buyers and media can attend, ensuring maximum sales and exposure for vegan businesses in the UK, resulting in added accessibility for vegan consumers nationwide.” At only 10 years old vegan advocate Genesis Butler continued to open hearts and minds with her inspiring speeches – including a TED talk. According to Butler, being young gives her an edge as an activist. She says: “They like that I am a kid who is doing what I believe in.  “They are really interested in what I have to say, and I think they take me more seriously because they know I am speaking from my heart.  “They listen to me more than adults. When my Mom tells people she doesn’t believe in killing animals for food, they give her lots of excuses.  “When I tell them the same thing, they listen and want to know more.” The Telegraph was just one of the major newspapers to feature veganism heavily this year, when it published a story in August asking whether we should all go vegan. The piece looked at various reasons for ditching animal products, and said: “Veganism’s rise in popularity is not necessarily to do with a concern for animals.  “The industrial farming of livestock is a major contributor to greenhouse gases; it also uses land, water and energy and requires food that could be eaten by humans.” According to animal rights group PETA, there was a huge spike in the number of people searching the term ‘vegan’ on Google – and it’s all down to the film Okja. The film, which has an animal rights perspective, tells the story of ‘superpig’ Okja, who has been genetically modified to feed as many people as possible. PETA’s Vice President Colleen O’Brien said: “In July alone, PETA received more than 21,000 requests for our vegan starter kits—double the number of an average month. “These powerful films are creating a new generation of vegans, one screening at a time.” Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown took a gamble this year when he insisted his plant-based Beyond Burger was sold in the meat aisle at a major supermarket – as opposed to sold separately with veggie products. The significance of this shouldn’t be underestimated. According to Quartz: “Not long ago, the prospect of infiltrating the meat section was a wild dream for companies working on plant- and lab-based meats.  “In breaking that barrier, Beyond Meat has opened the window for massive disruption of the traditional meat industry.” Thousands took to the streets of Tel Aviv in September, in what was described as the ‘biggest march ever’ for animal rights. The event, which was organized by a number of animal organizations including Vegan Friendly, Anonymous for Animal Rights and Let the Animals Live, hosted speeches from high profile activists like PETA Founder Ingrid Newkirk and James Aspey. Speaking before the annual event, Shira Hertzanu Head of Media Relations at Anonymous for Animal Rights, said: “Tonight is the biggest animal rights march in history. “We are expecting 30,000 marchers to arrive here to demand justice and compassion for all animals. “We’re talking about all kinds of animals – animals in the food industry, animals in the wild, and cats and dogs. “All the people who are coming here tonight are caring people who don’t want to see animals being harmed.” Celebrity make-up entrepreneur and tattoo artist Kat Von D revealed this year that she would be expanding her empire to include a plant-based shoe line. Taking to Instagram to share her news, she captioned one picture: “Day 1 of working on my upcoming #vegan shoe collection.  “Sizing up heels for this pair of post-apocalyptic asymmetrical vegan-leather heels I designed. #KatVonDshoes #Comingsoon.” Von D also showed off some heel choices for the range, including a black diamond-shaped design. She added: “Crystallized. Geometric. Sculpted custom heels. Seriously can’t wait to finally launch this shoe line.” In one of October’s biggest stories, Hollywood heavyweight Leonardo DiCaprio announced he had invested in plant-meat tech startup Beyond Meat. The vegan, sustainable brand has gained acclaim for its flagship Beyond Burger, which tastes and looks like meat – but is made entirely from plants. According to DiCaprio, plant-based meat is the future. He said: “Livestock production is a major contributor to carbon emissions.  “Shifting from animal meat to the plant-based meats developed by Beyond Meat is one of the most powerful measures someone can take to reduce their impact on our climate. “The company’s ability to create healthy meat directly from plants will go a long way in helping everyday consumers take action on climate change.” Athletes – including numerous NBA and NFL stars – went vegan in their droves this year, many after watching smash hit documentary What the Health. Among them was Lewis Hamilton – who went on to win his fourth F1 Championship after making the switch. Speaking about his new lifestyle he said: “When I speak to my friends and family they say, ‘I could never be on a plant-based diet, I could never be vegan’. “It’s weird, because once you cross that line and go over the hill I can’t imagine going back. “There’s things I see my friends eating – and I used to eat it – but now I feel sick because I have read about it and have read some of the science.” In August of this year, CNCB reported shared a story about a group of plant-based investors known as the ‘vegan mafia’, plunging cash into innovative animal-free products. The article described the ‘mafia’ as a ‘group of powerful vegans across the country who fund start-ups, and try to wean people from their dependence on animal products’. According to mafia member Ryan Bethencourt, who runs bio-tech accelerator IndieBio: “There’s a whole community of us that are building and funding vegan companies.” Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat are listed as some of the most significant plant-based tech start-ups for investors. There is a common thread among the members of the group – they are not investing in products aimed at vegans. The article said: “Instead, they are investing in products that appeal to the masses because they are healthier and cheaper.” Lots of people – including top athletes – credited documentary What the Health with inspiring them to go plant-based. They were not alone. According to reports earlier this summer, a screening of the movie in Dallas, Texas led to a spike in the number of local vegans. According to Dallas restauranteurs, people were coming in to eat, saying they were inspired by What the Health. V-Eats Modern Vegan owner Troy Gardner said: “It’s crazy that I’ve heard so much about [What the Health] in such a short period of time.  “And just 10 minutes ago, the gentleman who services our dish machine at the restaurant was telling me how he and his wife have just gone vegan. “Yesterday was their first day, and he cited What the Health as the thing that pushed them over the edge.” Always on the cutting edge of culture, iconic cartoon South Park centered one of its episodes around a vegan storyline. In an episode called Doubling Down, famously cantankerous character Eric Cartman is persuaded to give the lifestyle a go by ex-girlfriend Heidi after he blames his bad behavior on his bad diet. One of the plant-based world’s most high-tech products even makes an appearance in the episode, when Cartman visits Heidi at home, saying: “You were so right when you said there were vegan options for everything. “Remember how you told me about Beyond Meat? I tried it and you were right – you can’t even tell the difference between that and real meat.” But there is a twist in the story when Cartman tells Heidi that various omni foods are vegan. “You gotta try this,” he says. “It’s called Beyond KFC. It’s plant-based, soy protein – you just gotta try it.” Heidi’s new diet of ‘Beyond Arbys’ and other non-vegan foods leads to some side effects, including feeling ill and weight gain. In one of the biggest victories for the vegan movement this year the Advertising Standards Authority [ASA] cleared an advertisement by Go Vegan World that states: “Humane milk is a myth. Don’t buy it.” The advert – which was featured in The Sunday Telegraph – pictures a cow standing behind barbed wire. Words on the ad say: “I went vegan the day I visited a dairy. The mothers, still bloody from birth, searched and called frantically for their babies. “Their daughters, fresh from their mothers’ wombs but separated from them, trembled and cried piteously, drinking milk from rubber teats on the wall instead of their mothers’ nurturing bodies. All because humans take their milk.” The ASA received challenges from seven complainants about the ad – some of whom work or have worked in the dairy industry, but it cleared the ad of any wrongdoing Higgins welcomed her win saying: “Dairy is inherently inhumane.” In one of the year’s most popular stories, fast food giant McDonald’s started testing a vegan burger – known (unsurprisingly as the ‘McVegan’) in Finland during October. Christoffer Rönnblad, Marketing Director of McDonald’s in Finland, said the response had been positive, adding: “We are following the reaction with interest and we are happy to receive feedback. “That’s the purpose of the trial.” Whatever the outcome, he confirmed that the brand will continue to expand its meat-free offerings in the future. He added: “The vegan hamburger required extensive in-house product development. The [vegan] hamburger steak is soy based.  “We were really passionate about finding a steak that tastes really good.” Conservation charity the WWF published a report this year which warned that eating meat is devastating parts of the world because of the amount of land needed to produce animal feed. The report, called Appetite for Destruction, launched at the Extinction and Livestock Conference. According to WWF Food Policy Manager Duncan Williamson: “The world is consuming more animal protein than it needs and this is having a devastating effect on wildlife. “A staggering 60 per cent of global biodiversity loss is down to the food we eat.  “We know a lot of people are aware that a meat-based diet has an impact on water and land, as well as causing greenhouse gas emissions, but few know the biggest issue of all comes from the crop-based feed the animals eat.” You canwatch PBN’s entire film Vegan 2017 here ?Studio Giant 20th Century Fox Teams Up With Vegan Sanctuary To Promote New Animal Movie ‘The Rumors Are True’: Pizza Hut Rolls Out Vegan Cheese Due To ‘Phenomenal Demand’ Report Calls On Meat Industry To ‘Wake Up’ As Plant Based Alternatives Skyrocket "
7958,VEGAN POWER: Disrupting The Global $90 Billion Meat Market,https://plantbasednews.org/opinion/vegan-disrupting-global-90-billion-meat-market/,2017-11-13,"The global meat industry is facing an unprecedented challenge. People are becoming more conscious about issues around ethics and the environment – and they are starting to change their behavior in droves. Misuse of antibiotics in farming is a ticking time bomb, hurtling us towards a terrifying post-antibiotic era, where even simple infections could kill us. In recent times, movies like What the Health have inspired millions to ditch animal products. Top plant-based physician Dr. Michael Greger’s book How Not to Die about the benefits of a vegan diet topped the New York Times‘ bestseller list for months. On top of all that, look at concepts like veganism, plant-based diets, Veganuary, Meat Free Mondays, flexitarianism. Together, these factors are changing the way millions of us eat. In tandem with these behavior changes, a slew of entrepreneurs and disrupters are working on building new foods – healthier and more ethical alternatives to traditional animal-based options. Names like Pat Brown, Josh Tetrick, Ethan Brown, Uma Valeti may not be mainstream yet. These are just some of the key characters driving massive change.  But more about them later… At present, around 30 percent of the calories consumed globally by humans come directly from animal sources including cows, pigs, and chickens, according to data company CB insights. This equates to more than 50 billion animals farmed for food every year (not including fishes, who we kill in quantities so vast we count them by weight, rather than number). Right now, the meat industry is a complex, sprawling giant, with many stages from farm to table, including transport, slaughter, processing, and more. According to CB Insights: “Together, the seven largest meat companies combine for over $71B in market capitalization, with the largest, Tyson, boasting a $26B valuation.” But with so many signs that progress is starting to happen on a meaningful level – how long can this aging industry keep its grip on the market? Earlier this year, Josh Tetrick – the maverick CEO of Just (formerly Hampton Creek) – made a surprise announcement that suggested real change is on the horizon when it comes to disrupting animal agriculture. He describes the sustainability issues in food production as ‘one of the biggest problems facing humanity right now’, listing antibiotic overuse, greenhouse gas emissions, and rainforest destruction as factors in farming animals for people to eat. “But we’ve figured out a way to solve it,” he says. According to Tetrick, his company is working on its own cultured meat technology – and plans to bring the product to market in 2018 (see video above). Cultured (aka lab or bio) meat involves ‘building’ the flesh from animal cells.  While the use of these cells (as well as a serum taken from calves) means the product isn’t vegan, it does offer the potential to reduce animal suffering, as well as cut dangerous greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the sterile lab environment means the product won’t be contaminated with substances like faeces, and the use of antibiotics will be not be necessary. But there was a twist to follow – and this was far more significant. Tetrick claims to ‘be in talks’ with 10 of the leading global meat giants, who could be interested in licensing his cultured meat technology. These companies would then use this tech in place of traditional farming methods. In a bleak, but realistic summation of human nature, Tetrick reasoned that production of cultured meat has to happen on a wide scale to make it financially viable enough to have a meaningful impact. He says: “Ultimately, anything we do in this space is irrelevant if we cannot make is as, if not more, affordable than the core categories of conventional meat today – it’s a waste of our time. “I’m not a big believer that conscious consumerism is going to initiate a fundamental transformation. “I think what creates a transformation in how folks eat is if you create products that taste better, are more affordable, and connect with people.”  PBN examines whether lab meat is ethical Tetrick isn’t heading up the only brand racing to bring a lab meat product to market. Memphis Meats, headed up by former cardiologist Uma Valeti is also in hot contention. The company, which recently featured on Inc. magazine’s cover, was described by the publication as the most credible competitor in the lab meat race. In the cover’s accompanying featured titled Why This Cardiologist Is Betting That His Lab-Grown Meat Startup Can Solve the Global Food Crisis, writer Jeff Bercovici said: “The basic science to grow meat in a lab has existed for more than 20 years, but no one has come close to making cultured meat anywhere near as delicious or as affordable as the real thing. “But sometime in the next few years, someone will succeed in doing just that, tapping into a global market that’s already worth trillions of dollars and expected to double in size in the next three decades. “Despite a bevy of well-funded competitors, no one is better positioned than Memphis Meats to get there first.” Memphis Meats also has cash behind it: Bill Gates and Richard Branson were just two of the investors behind the company’s recent $17 million Series A funding round. Traditional meat companies also invested in the technology. Memphis Meats is the subject of an upcoming documentary Lab meat is not the only product set to disrupt traditional animal agriculture – completely plant-based tech start-ups have already brought products to market which are making waves. Leading the charge when it comes to these animal-free ‘meats’ are Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat, who have both created revolutionary meat-free ‘bleeding’ burgers. The companies have approached the whole ‘building’ of meat from a new, scientific angle, using high-tech ingredients to recreate certain flavors or textures. Impossible Foods uses ‘heme’ – a an iron-rich molecule found in the blood – to give its patties that ‘meaty’ flavor. Only this ingredient is genetically modified from yeast, rather than taken from animals. Products created by companies like these are not just for vegans – they are are focused on those who do eat meat and don’t want to compromise on the taste of animal flesh. According Impossible Foods CEO Pat Brown: “We think of it as meat made a better way. Meat today basically is made using pre-historic technology, using animals to turn plants into this very special category of food. “But to your typical consumer… the value proposition of meat has nothing to do with its coming from an animal.” The company is expected to extend its technology to create other meat alternative foods in the future.  While Beyond Meat’s flagship product is its burger – which is available for delivery everywhere in the US now – it also makes a range of other items, including beef crumbles and chicken strips, which retail in a number of major outlets. It is reportedly working on a pork replacement product. The company, led by Ethan Brown (see interview below) has notably powerful financial backing – with cash from Hollywood heavyweight Leonardo DiCaprio, as well as a five percent stake owned by Tyson (that’s right – the meat processor). The growth of these disrupters makes the corporations who are most reliant on animal exploitation – like Tyson – most vulnerable. This is something the global giants are aware of – over the last year, Tyson has invested in this new disruptive technology, buying a five percent stake in Beyond Burger in October 2016. At the time, Tyson senior vice president in charge of strategy Monica McGurk, said: “We think it’s a game-changing product that gives us exposure to this fast-growing part of the food business.” The company has hinted that it will have to adapt to a world where animals are not the only – or even the key – protein source on a number of occasions, including recently, when Tyson Foods CEO Tom Hayes admitted that plant protein was essential is ensuring food security during an interview on North Carolina Public Radio.  PBN speaks with Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown The massive advances in food tech mean that alternative products are becoming increasingly tasty, and meat-like. In addition, they are far more sustainable on an environmental level. Last week, the World Health Organization again called upon agriculture to look at its use of antibiotics.  The use of these medicines to promote growth and disease prevention in otherwise healthy animals, is hurtling us towards what some have described as a ‘post antibiotic future’ – where even simple infections could kill us. This is not to mention ethical concerns; many billions of animals suffer unimaginably throughout their short lives, before meeting a frightening, violent end in the slaughterhouse. Plant-based meat would solve these issues; and lab meat would solve many of them.  Animal agriculture is likely to fight against the impending changes The clean meat sector is facing its own issues. Primarily, one of marketing. For many, the idea of meat grown in a lab is ‘disgusting’ or ‘unnatural’ (let’s not get into how factory farming and genetically unmodified animals are unnatural right now). Additionally, while high profile investors have been ploughing cash into the top tech players, it is pricy to bring these products to market. If that pricing can’t match cheap supermarket flesh, a huge proportion of people will choose not to buy it, or won’t be able to afford it. Scale could be another factor; will these companies – both the plant meat and lab meat brands – be able to make enough of the product to feed the world? On top of this, both Just and Impossible Foods have been the subject of scandal this year, when it was revealed both companies had tested ingredients on lab rats. Both companies said the testing was essential in order to get FDA [Food and Drug Administration] safety clearance on new ingredients. Impossible Foods CEO Pat Brown described the decision as ‘agonizing’, while Tetrick said it was essential in order to progress on a wider scale more quickly.  Is the future vegan? While brands like Tyson seem to be preparing for a plant protein-heavy future, the powerful animal agriculture lobby as a whole is unlikely to back down without a fight. If you look at the ailing dairy industry, it has hit back hard at the plant-based milk sector, with court cases and lobbying to ensure products can’t use words like ‘milk’ to describe themselves – not to mention campaigns smearing the health credentials of products like almond milk. Also, according to CB Insights: “The automation of meat production could have far-reaching job implications for the agriculture industry.  “The meat sector is the largest employer within US agriculture, and mainstream meatless consumption could create chaos and eliminate jobs across the entire meat production value chain. “Meat producers, lobbyists, and other bodies have a great deal at risk when considering the effects of automation across the meat industry.” This year has seen staggering development within the plant-based sector – with an increasing number of people choosing to eschew animal products. As replacement products become more accessible and more affordable, this change is likely to create a feedback loop of supply and demand. People are becoming increasingly aware that farming animals for food is no longer sustainable in terms of antibiotic resistance and the environment. Additionally, young people are driving the move way from animal foods – suggesting we are moving towards a food revolution. According to CB Insights: “Regardless of the hurdles to a meatless future, clean meat products are clearly diversifying and growing, capturing investor and public attention alike.” How To Eat Like Top Plant Based Physician Dr. Michael Greger BREAKING: Domino’s Confirms It Will Add Vegan Cheese To Its Pizzas Vegan Rapper On Internet Backlash: ‘People Are So Eager To Find Fault’ "
8008,‘Lab Meat’ Pioneer Memphis Meats On Cover Of Iconic Inc. Magazine,https://plantbasednews.org/culture/memphis-meats-cover-inc-magazine/,2017-07-11,"Memphis Meats CEO Uma Valetti is on the cover of the current Inc. magazine. The trained cardiologist is considered to be one of the pioneers of the ‘clean meat’ movement. The cover is accompanied by a featured titled Why This Cardiologist Is Betting That His Lab-Grown Meat Startup Can Solve the Global Food Crisis. Clean meat – also known as lab, bio, or cultured meat – is built using animal cells. It is therefore not vegan, though some vegans choose to support the concept, as it has the potential to reduce the number of animals slaughtered for food. It is also a more environmentally friendly option than traditional livestock farming. Memphis Meats – which famously created a ‘meatball’ in 2016 – recently received $17 million in Series A funding. It expects to have its product in stores by 2021.  Plant Based News discusses the ethics around lab grown meat According to a Memphis Meats spokesperson: “Clean meat has made the cover of Inc. Magazine, one of the most prestigious business publications in the world. “Inc.’s current issue contains an exclusive interview with our CEO, and powerfully describes our vision of a ‘world without slaughter’.” According to Inc.:”The basic science to grow meat in a lab has existed for more than 20 years, but no one has come close to making cultured meat anywhere near as delicious or as affordable as the real thing. “But sometime in the next few years, someone will succeed in doing just that, tapping into a global market that’s already worth trillions of dollars and expected to double in size in the next three decades. “Despite a bevy of well-funded competitors, no one is better positioned than Memphis Meats to get there first.” Vegan Celeb Alicia Silverstone Shares Her Green Beauty Routine Vegans SLAM ‘Insensitive’ Meat Joke In Major Retailer Woolworths Heartbreaking Animal Stories Inspired This Sanctuary’s Innovative New Idea "
8107,NOW?AVAILABLE: Waitrose Launches Exciting New Vegan Options – Including ‘Pulled Pork’,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/waitrose-launches-exciting-new-vegan-options/,2017-10-26,"Major UK retailer Waitrose has launched a range of veggie and vegan products – expanding its meat-free offering by 35 percent in order to meet customer demand. The range, which includes 30 dishes in total (including 11 plant-based), is available now. Products were developed in collaboration with The Vegetarian Butcher, a Dutch company specializing in meat substitutes. They feature what a spokesperson described as ‘a new soya protein’. The spokesperson added: “Waitrose is the first UK supermarket to use this brand of alternative protein which looks like and has the texture of meat, appealing to those who want to reduce the amount of meat in their diet without the compromise.” The spokesperson said: “According to a Mintel report earlier this year,* demand for meat-free food is forecast to rise by nine percent over the next five years to 2021.  “And this trend isn’t limited to the buying choices of vegetarians and vegans.  “Flexitarianism, a term for those who want to reduce but not completely stop their meat intake, was added to the Oxford English Dictionary as recently as 2014.” The Vegetarian Butcher, which was founded by 9th generation farmer Jaap Korteweg in 2010, uses plant-proteins to make meat replacements. The brand began as a single shop but now sells products in 16 countries.  A Waitrose spokesperson said: “The Vegetarian Butcher has teamed up with Waitrose to develop its own label range of ready meals which includes a tikka masala, lasagne and green Thai curry which have been made as close as possible to the retailer’s best selling meat versions, but with a vegetarian recipe.” Korteweg added: “Our ideal is to have meat enthusiasts experience our products and then realise they don’t have to miss out on anything if they take meat out of their diet for one or more days.  “That is why we always try to capture the flavour of real meat and why we characterise ourselves as an entirely new generation of meat substitutes that are, according to top chefs, indistinguishable from the real thing.” Chloe Graves, Waitrose Vegetarian Buyer, said: “This is our largest ever meat-free range. Vegetarian meals are one of our fastest growing categories with sales up 14 percent year on year and we know this will only get bigger.  “There’s little doubt that plant protein will play an increasingly important part in a healthy balanced diet in the future.  “By working with The Vegetarian Butcher we can offer our shoppers a first-to-market high quality replacement protein that is more akin to the texture of meat than anything we have stocked before.  “This will appeal to flexitarians who want to reduce their meat intake without the compromise, but is also suitable for vegetarians.” Vegan dishes in the range include a 10 percent dairy-free spreadable cheese called Sheese, vegan style pulled pork, and a handmade tofu.

The partnership is one of many formed by the vegan Prince in pursuit of his ambition to end factory farming. Several weeks ago, his investment company KBW Ventures was part of a cohort that pumped $17 million into high-tech cultured meat company Memphis Meats. Last week it was announced that he has joined the board of directors at startup Hampton Creek which makes a wide range of plant-based foods. He has also injected cash into green energy. PBN currently has a global weekly reach of around five million people, sharing vegan-interest content including articles, original videos and interviews. According to the Prince, it is a ‘beautiful platform for helping people to understand exactly what a plant-based diet is, and what that means for animals’. He adds: “It was a good medium for myself to partner with two talented individuals. “I truly believe we share the same passion for ending factory farming, as well as giving people alternative ways to improve their nutrition and change their eating habits.” Prince Khaled believes the site offers valuable insight into animal agriculture and farming. He says: “Even more importantly, I thought Plant Based News offered a better way for people to understand what was happening in the traditional agricultural sectors. “Are the meat and dairy industries struggling? Let’s just report the facts to people and have them decide for themselves.” He also believes there is space to report the news often missing from mainstream media outlets. “You won’t find the New York Times or the Washington Post talking about what the US Ag-Gag law is – but you will find us talking about it, and what it means for animals and for your health as an individual.” Originally started by Klaus Mitchell in 2015 as a social media project, Robbie Lockie came on board in 2016 to help grow the audience. In February of this year, the company was registered. Founder Klaus Mitchell says: “While it’s great that the sharing of information online is more democratic, it can be difficult to ascertain what is credible. “We provide fact-based, balanced information. Readers and viewers can come to us to find news about the impact a plant-based diet can have on our health, animals, and the environment.” Co-founder Robbie Lockie adds: “People may want to improve their health, increase their understanding of ethics or reduce their carbon footprint, but are bombarded with conflicting messages. “We want to disrupt this conventional narrative by thwarting the misinformation shared by the powerful animal agriculture lobby.” The company, which currently employs a number of people across the US and UK, will be using the partnership to expand its operation – increasing output and reaching a wider audience. “We want to transcend borders, languages and cultures to reach people around the world,” says Lockie.  “This is our vision.” For further information on this story, please contact maria@plantbasednews.org Saudi Prince Joins Board Of Directors At Plant-Based Startup Hampton Creek DEBUT: Plant Based News To Make First VegFest Appearance In October Plant Based News Nominated For Award!

8454,Lab Meat Continues To Spark Debate Among Vegans,https://plantbasednews.org/news/controversial-lab-meat-continues-to-spark-debate-among-vegans/,2017-09-15,"Lab meat, also known as cultured or bio meat, continues to spark controversy among the vegan community. Cultured meat is grown in a laboratory using animal cells, which is not entirely slaughter-free – thus prompting fierce debate between vegans. While some support the concept, many vegans are completely against it. Facebook user Ian Parker is ‘all for it’, saying: “It’s NOT aimed at those of us who know the health challenges of consuming animal products, but rather those than cannot give up the meat, fish and dairy drug.” Another argued that “Anything which will have the meatheads eating less murdered animals is a good thing.” The majority of vegans agree that although they wouldn’t eat the lab meat themselves, it’s also a means to an end. “I would never eat this lab meat, but I hope this becomes the mainstream amongst meat eaters,” commented Robin Jagoda. Adam Stallings also believes in the importance of cultured meat: “This will be the only method to significantly reduce animal cruelty and its damages to the climate/environment.” User Carol Nico, however, believes the opposite: “Disgusting… for me it’s like creating fake children for pedophiles in order to save some real children lives and to make good profits. “The world won’t change if we keep seeing and treating BODIES as food. It’s time to turn the page and let this cruel culture and all this unnecessary violence behind.” Another Facebook user added: “Even if slaughter isn’t involved, we do not need animals for any reason other than companionship.” “Still gross… still unhealthy, still unnecessary. Money and resources could be going towards other things,” Stephanie Sierks chipped in. ‘Colossal Opportunity’ As China Signs $300 Million Deal To Buy Israel Lab Meat As Lab Meat Row Rages On: Watch The Trailer For 2019 Memphis Meats Documentary ‘Lab Meat’ Leader Memphis Meats Announces $17 Million Investment From Bill Gates, Richard Branson – And Meat Industry "

Khaled bin Alwaleed Alsaud, who has invested in green companies including Memphis Meats through his company KBW Ventures, took to Facebook to share the news with his followers. The Saudi Prince will join the Hampton Creek team, along with DuPont’s former Vice President Jim Borel, founder of The Carbon Underground Larry Kopald, and Cliff Coles, a former Heinz food safety expert. The food technology company has also appointed three new advisors, including technology entrepreneur Peter Diamandis, MarketShare CEO Jon Vein, and daughter of Dutch entrepreneur Willem van Eelen, Ira van Eelen. He wrote: “Remember when I said ‘my main goal is to relegate factory farming and put it in the dustbin of history?’ “I wasn’t kidding around. Thank you and thank God I joined the board of directors of Hampton Creek, one of the largest companies in the world for plant products.” He added: “I have been born into a situation that gives me the capacity to make a significant positive influence in the world.  “Industrial animal agriculture is poisoning our planet, depleting resources, contributing to a global health crisis, and causing animal suffering beyond anything most of us can imagine.” Silicon Valley startup Hampton Creek is currently working on a number of products. Its flagship item is Just Mayo – a plant-based alternative to mayonnaise. The company is also working on creating cultured meat – with ambitious plans to get the product to mass market in 2018. Hampton Creek CEO Josh Tetrick commented: “As we’ve said before, we believe eating well is a basic right and if a decision?—?from the people we bring onboard to the technologies we develop to the products we launch?—?increases the probability of achieving our mission in our lifetimes, we’ll do it.  “If a decision decreases that probability, we won’t. That’s our operating principle, whether privately held or publicly traded.

8565,PBN EXCLUSIVE: Hampton Creek CEO Josh Tetrick Talks About Animal Testing,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/pbn-exclusive-hampton-creek-ceo-josh-tetricks-talks-about-animal-testing/,2017-04-09," Josh Tetrick is a man in a rush. As CEO of vegan startup Hampton Creek – and a true pioneer of the plant-based food tech movement – Tetrick wants to do everything as quickly as possible. “If I’m lucky,” the 37-year-old who has been diagnosed with heart condition hypertrophic cardiomyopathy tells PBN, “I’ll live till I’m 70. “Until then, I need to use every second to do good. “I’m trying to build a company that can have a full impact because that’s the only thing I f**king care about.” This ability to look at the bigger picture has come in handy; the last few years have seen his company come under attack from a number of opponents. According to some sources, Tetrick has been the subject of death threats.  His company has faced legal action from corporate giant Unilever (who didn’t want Hampton Creek’s egg-free mayo labeled as ‘mayonnaise’), as well as a slew of negative, and often inaccurate, press reports. Now Tetrick is facing another battle: his company recently incurred the wrath of some of the animal rights community when it revealed it had tested a new ingredient on animals. While Tetrick says the testing was necessary to move forward with creating innovative plant-based products, opponents have branded the choice as unnecessary and exploitative. Animal rights charity PETA was one of the company’s most vocal critics, launching a campaign urging Hampton Creek (along with fellow food tech company Impossible Foods) to stop all testing – and commit to never testing in the future. A PETA spokesperson told PBN: “Consumers who seek out vegan foods because they don’t want to add the suffering of animals should know that Impossible Food and Hampton Creek chose to test on animals – even though they weren’t required to do so, and are outraged. “We felt it important for these companies to hear from their customers and they have, by the tens of thousands.” So what’s Tetrick’s side of the story? And is Hampton Creek currently testing on animals? “No, we are not testing on animals at the moment,” he tells PBN. So why did the company test in the first place? Tetrick says: “There’s something called Generally Regarded As Safe [GRAS]. It’s a way the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] gives its official stamp of approval regarding the safety of products we eat in the US. “There are only about seven plant proteins that are regarded as safe in the US food system. We found a really compelling kind of bean called mung bean that’s been in the system for about 4,000 + years, and it’s incredible.” The company wanted to use a protein isolate from the beans. Tetrick says: “We were required by the FDA to get a ‘no questions order’ and to get this there’s a process we had to go through that was looking at the digestibility of the mung bean, so what we did was we fed rats the mung bean isolate, and then [new product] scrambled eggs, and we looked at poop. “In a perfect world we’d certainly have an FDA that would give the ‘no questions’ letter without even looking at digestibility – but we live in an imperfect world.” After food tech startup Impossible Foods revealed it had tested on animals, company founder, and longterm vegan, Pat Brown claimed the decision had been ‘agonizing’ – forcing him to sacrifice short term integrity for long term gain. Is this dilemma becoming a trend in food tech? Tetrick claims not. “I don’t see that as a trend at all,” he says. According to the entrepreneur, the vast majority of vegan mock meats will contain ingredients, that at one time, were tested on animals. “It’s unfortunate, but even take something like xantham gum, which is used in the majority of the products you’re enjoying every single day – that particular ingredient had to go through the GRAS process. “Do you believe choosing those products is good for the world? How do you balance the negative association with supporting them? “We all have to make that choice, right?” PETA claims the dilemma is much more clear cut, with a spokesperson telling PBN: “FDA approval is not required in order to market food products, so there is no uphill battle with the FDA. “Impossible Foods and Hampton Creek voluntarily sought FDA approval and voluntarily commissioned the tests on rats. “They didn’t have to harm animals, they should not have done it, and they should commit to never testing on animals again.” But this is not entirely true, according to Bruce Friedrich, Executive Director of the Good Food Institute, who writes: “Unfortunately, FDA essentially requires that companies conduct animal tests if they want to introduce novel ingredients into the food supply.  “Although these tests have been painted as discretionary in some quarters, in fact, FDA appears to require animal tests of any company that wishes to receive explicit acknowledgment from FDA that its new ingredient is safe (called a ‘no questions’ letter).” For Tetrick, it comes down to impact; he is emphatic about what he sees as the bigger picture – effecting the biggest possible change within the smallest time frame. “I’m very realistic about how far we are from really building the food system,” he tells PBN. “We need to build and we have a long, long way to go. We gotta get at it, and we gotta be f**king aggressive.  “We have to get back to work. We can’t let ourselves get caught up by the frivolous things [inaccurate media reporting]. We focus on doing good work – ethical work – real work. “That’s what makes the difference.” You can watch a PBN special report on this topic over on YouTubehere BLOOMBERG REPORTS: Retail Giant Target Ditches Hampton Creek Products Permanently Hampton Creek ‘In Talks’ With Global Meat Giants To License Its Cultured Meat Technology Hampton Creek Hires Investigators After Products Removed From Target Stores: Discovers Fraud New Problems For Vegan Start-Up Hampton Creek As Products Removed From Stores "

Hoping to address some of those questions is a feature-length documentary about cultured meat that will be released in 2019.  The trailer, which can you watch here, was released in October 2016. Meat the Future focuses on the ‘clean meat’ movement, following Memphis Meats’ CEO and Co-founder Dr. Uma Valeti. Speaking about creating meat in a lab, Dr. Valeti says: “Knowing that this has never been done in history before? That’s the part that’s incredibly motivating.  “The story is yet to be told.” A statement by director Liz Marshall – director of The Ghosts In Our Machine – says: “Meat the Future is a natural extension of my previous work.  “Since the 1990s I have had the privilege of featuring resilient stories around the globe, shot within the context of war, climate change, corporate industrialized globalization, and the HIV/AIDS pandemic.  “Meat the Future spotlights a convergence of urgent issues through an active unfolding human story.  “This is a documentary that grapples with significant global challenges, while looking to what is possible.  “Meat the Future is not another doomsday survey that leaves audiences feeling overwhelmed with information overload.  “Instead, we zoom in on compelling people working overtime, risking everything to make a difference, while also examining the challenges and obstacles they face.” The cultured meat sector has come in for criticism from some vegans, as animal cells are needed to create the product, meaning the product still uses animals.  Furthermore, the harvesting of these cells can involve slaughter. Commenting on the film’s Facebook Page, Mary Mellozzi wrote: “Use those millions to RESCUE animals instead. Animals, whether 1 or a billion is irrelevant, will still be slaughtered for this unnecessary fake meat which will never be of interest for meat eaters to consume [sic].” But proponents of cultured meat – which is also known as lab, bio, or in vitro meat – claim the technology could save billions of animals’ lives – and help fight climate change. Bruce Friedrich, the Executive Director of the Good Food Institute says: “The really big questions in food production are how are we going to feed 9 billion people by 2050, and especially what are we going to do about climate change? “And we’re not going to do it with the climate nightmare that is animal agriculture.”  You can watchthe trailer for Meat the Future here.

Memphis Meats, which has already produced beef, chicken, and duck directly from animal cells, received $17 million in its recent funding round, taking its total funding up to $22 million. Clean meat – known as lab, bio, or cultured meat – is built using animal cells. Some scientists also use foetal blood plasma harvested from unborn calves (though some brands say they have developed technology to avoid this). Clean meat is therefore not vegan, though some vegans choose to support the concept, as it has the potential to reduce the number of animals slaughtered for food. Investors included computer magnate Bill Gates and Virgin entrepreneur Richard Branson, as well as meat giant Cargill. New Crop Capital, SOSV, Fifty Years, KBW Ventures,
Inevitable Ventures, Suzy and Jack Welch, Kyle Vogt, and Kimbal Musk also participated. Multiple
research institutions joined the round. The company described the meat industry’s involvement as ‘the first public commitment to the clean meat movement by top venture investors or meat industry leaders’.  WATCH: PBN asks vegans what they think of lab meat  WATCH: PBN asks vegans what they think of lab meat A spokesperson for the company said: “Memphis Meats plans to use the funds to continue developing delicious products, to accelerate its work
in scaling up clean meat production, and to reduce production costs to levels comparable to – and
ultimately below – conventional meat costs.  “The company expects to quadruple its headcount, and has
already begun growing its team of chefs, scientists creative people and business people.”  Uma Valeti, M.D., co-founder and CEO of Memphis Meats, added: “We’re going to bring meat to the plate in a more sustainable, affordable and delicious way. “The world loves to eat meat, and it is core to
many of our cultures and traditions. Meat demand is growing rapidly around the world. We want the
world to keep eating what it loves.  “However, the way conventional meat is produced today creates
challenges for the environment, animal welfare and human health.  “These are problems that everyone
wants to solve, and we can solve them by bringing this incredible group of partners under one tent. This
group will help us accelerate our progress significantly.” Sonya McCullum Roberts, President of Growth Ventures for Cargill Protein, added: “We are committed to growing our traditional protein business and investing in innovative new proteins
to ultimately provide a complete basket of goods to our customers. “Our investment in Memphis Meats is an exciting way for
Cargill to explore the potential in this growing segment of the protein market.  “Memphis Meats has the
potential to provide our customers and consumers with expanded protein choices and is aligned with
our mission to nourish the world in a safe, responsible and sustainable way.” According to Bruce Friedrich, Executive Director of the Good Food Institute – an organization that supports the growth of non-animal protein – the investment marks a ‘momentous’ occasion. He said: “This is a momentous occasion for anyone who wants to see a food system that is safe, good for the
planet and animals, and completely satisfying to consumers. “Memphis Meats is doing amazing work to make this vision a reality.  “We are
excited to welcome a meat industry leader into the fold, and I believe they have enormous potential to
support and accelerate this work. For animal welfare and environmental advocates, today is a huge step

The University of California, Berkeley is creating an ‘Alternative Meats Lab’ known as the alt.meat lab, which will offer the latest technology and tools to allow students to ‘build’ plant-based meat. Last semester, UC Berkeley offered the world’s first course entirely focused on developing plant-meat products. The course was so popular it will be offered again. The lab and the course will be led by the Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship & Technology [SCET] at the university – a center which helps students create tech startups. SCET has joined forces with the Good Food Institute [GFI], a non-profit which champions the alternative meat market. GFI will provide domain expertise, as well as connections. GFI Senior Scientist, Christie Lagally, says: “This course is a unique opportunity for students to work collaboratively with experts in the food industry to tackle the complex technical challenges of designing and producing high-quality meat replacements that meet the needs of consumers.” The target of this alternative to animal flesh is not vegans and veggies – but meat-eaters. According to visiting professor Ricardo San Martin, co-chair for the new lab: “There is evidence that meat-lovers would buy plant-based meat alternatives if the taste is right. “One of our goals for the lab will be to develop delicious food that is similar to meat from a nutritional and functional perspective, but may not necessarily mimic meat exactly.” In order to create a product that is attractive to meat eaters, students will work with experts in the fields of flavor and fragrances. Ikhlaq Sidhu, faculty director and founder of the Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship & Technology at UC Berkeley, and professor in the Department of Industrial Engineering & Operations Research, said: “Through our network of alumni, investors, and founders, we determined that meat alternatives represent one of the biggest opportunities for creating a startup right now. “The market is huge, and we believe the technology is ready for entrepreneurs to compete with traditional meat in the near future.” Hampton Creek ‘In Talks’ With Global Meat Giants To License Its Cultured Meat Technology Building Meat From Plants: Interview with Beyond Meat Now Animal Ag Lobby Says Vegan Plant Meat ‘Can’t Be Called Meat’ "

JBS, which is the largest meat processing company in the world, reported a net profit of $97.1 million in the second quarter of 2017 – a 79.8 per cent drop from the same period last year. The figure fell well short of analysts’ forecast of $153.09 profit. JBS is currently at the center of a scandal, which has seen Brazilian President, Michel Temer hit with a conspiracy charge, after JBS bribed officials in order to keep substandard meat on the market. This scandal, known as ‘Operation Weak Flesh’ is believed to have hit profits hard. It has been described by some as Brazil’s biggest political scandal and the resulting arrests and reports had a hugely negative impact on the international image of Brazil’s agribusiness sector as a whole – resulting in JBS’ poor performance. ‘Meat Loving’ Reporter Goes Plant-Based For A Month: Find Out What Happened Newly Vegan Ne-Yo: ‘I Was A Lover Of Meat But It Literally Makes You Sick’ Hampton Creek ‘In Talks’ With Global Meat Giants To License Its Cultured Meat Technology "
8668,BLOOMBERG REPORTS: Retail Giant Target Ditches Hampton Creek Products Permanently,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/bloomberg-reports-retail-giant-target-ditches-hampton-creek-products/,2017-08-19,"US retail giant Target will be permanently ditching products made by vegan startup Hampton Creek, according to a story broken by Bloomberg. The products – including Hampton Creek’s flagship item Just Mayo – were removed from sale two months ago, after Target received an anonymous tip-off about safety issues. These safety claims included allegations that products posed health threats (for salmonella and listeria), and were mislabeled, containing undeclared ingredients including honey. But these claims were never substantiated. The Food and Drug Administration [FDA] said it was monitoring the situation, but had not received any reports of people falling ill from Hampton Creek products. Hampton Creek responded immediately to these allegations with a statement saying: “The allegations that our products are mislabeled and unsafe are false. “We have robust food safety standards, and as such, we remain confident about the safety of all products we sell and distribute. “We look forward to working with Target and the FDA to bring this to a quick resolution.” But despite the FDA clearing Hampton Creek, Target decided not to reinstate Hampton Creek’s products. An email statement by Target spokesperson Jenna Reck said: “Recently, the FDA closed its file on Hampton Creek products. “Although the FDA is not pursuing this further, we used the opportunity to review our portfolio, as we regularly do, and decided to reconsider our relationship with Hampton Creek. “We are not planning to bring Hampton Creek products back to Target and have openly communicated our decision with the Hampton Creek team.” Reck reportedly would not share any further details, saying simply that there were ‘multiple reasons for ending the deal’. With the Target deal worth a reported annual $5.5 million to the San Fran startup, the move will come as a blow to Hampton Creek, which has already seen its fair share of troubles. These include board members walking out, an alleged ‘coup’ attempt by former senior staff, legal wrangles, and reported death threats against CEO Josh Tetrick. According to Bloomberg, the relationship was severed because Target did not like the way Hampton Creek announced to the media that it had been cleared by the FDA. Hampton Creek spokesperson Andrew Noyes told Bloomberg: “Target informed us that sharing with the public the FDA’s conclusion that our products are safe violated Target’s vendor communication guidelines.” An email statement from Hampton Creek to tech news outlet TechCrunch said: “We understandably felt there was a necessity to share the FDA’s conclusions, so we did. “Target publicly said they would leave this in the hands of the FDA. “Target informed us that sharing with the public the FDA’s conclusion that our products are safe violated Target’s vendor communication guidelines. “Target told us that is what drove their decision to end our relationship.” Hampton Creek CEO Josh Tetrick added his own email statement that said: “We’re thankful to the millions of consumers and a growing number of partners who continue to support our mission to build a food system where everyone is eating well. “We’ve learned that focusing on doing good work, the kind that has an enduring impact, is the best way to approach these types of challenges.” Hampton Creek ‘In Talks’ With Global Meat Giants To License Its Cultured Meat Technology Hampton Creek Hires Investigators After Products Removed From Target Stores: Discovers Fraud New Problems For Vegan Start-Up Hampton Creek As Products Removed From Stores "

According to Josh Tetrick – CEO of the Silicon Valley company – he wants to bring industrialized production efficiency to lab-grown meat. Hampton Creek would grant commercial product licenses to the meat producers, who would then pay royalties. Tetrick’s reasoning is that production of cultured meat has to happen on a wide scale to make it financially viable enough to have a meaningful impact. He said: “Ultimately, anything we do in this space is irrelevant if we cannot make is as, if not more, affordable than the core categories of conventional meat today – it’s a waste of our time. “I’m not a big believer that conscious consumerism is going to initiate a fundamental transformation. “I think what creates a transformation in how folks eat is if you create products that taste better, are more affordable and connect with people.” While Tetrick has not yet revealed the identities of the companies he’s in negotiation with, he has implied they are household names. The cooperation he believes, is essential, saying this move ‘cannot be successful without the meat industry’. Further details will be released over the next 12 months – which will coincide with the company’s planned launch of its cultured meat into retail outlets.

Google has been working with a nonprofit organization called the Better Buying Lab, which studies the factors stopping consumers turning away from meat-heavy diets and strategizes to overcome them, for almost a year. One of the strategies is to create recipes that compete with what are described as ‘power dishes’ – that is, the most common main courses found on America’s menus.  These include chicken sandwiches and salad. In fact, of the country’s top 20 ‘power dishes’ – only one is meat-free (a veggie wrap). Working with Better Buying Lab, Google has been experimenting in the kitchen to find a ‘plant-forward’ meal that can permeate the top 20 list. Scott Giambastiani, Google’s Global Food Program Chef and Operations Manager, told Fast Company: “We were trying to solve for a delicious alternative that would displace a good proportion of animal protein. “It might be completely vegetarian, or it might be what we call a flipped product, where you’re eating 20 per cent or 30 per cent less of the animal protein.” Google has been most ‘aggressive’ in trying to cut its staff’s intake of beef – as the most environmentally intensive meat to rear – and has been doing so by replacing a percentage of the beef in certain dishes with vegetables.  For example, the burger served at Google is now 50 per cent beef, and 50 per cent mushrooms. It’s part of a strategy to reduce meat consumption in time, rather than try to convert staff instantly to vegetarianism. Giambastiani says: “It’s moving people along a continuum, whether people are eating red meat every day and you ask them to start eating a little more white meat, or they’re already on a white meat kick and it’s a little bit more seafood, or moving even further along to alternative proteins or produce.  “You can’t expect everyone to start loving lentils day one. Some do, most don’t. What you’re trying to do instead is get people to think about that continuum.” Google has integrated a number of other tweaks into its service in order to draw its staff toward healthier, more sustainable options. These include putting veg-heavy options at the top of the menu, using smaller plates and larger water glasses, and working hard to create tempting salad stations. Giambastiani says: “We need to think through how we can make a better choice easier for people.” Britain To Ban All New Petrol And Diesel Cars By 2040 In Bid To Save Planet France Bans Petrol And Diesel Cars – But Only Veganism Can Save The Planet Now WARNING: Earth’s Sixth Mass Extinction Happening Now – And It Is The Fault Of Humans "
8883,BBC Asks: Is Lab Meat The Future Of Food?,https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/bbc-vegan-plantbased-labmeat/,2017-10-07,"Lab meat (also known as cultured or bio meat) has made mainstream media headlines, with the BBC asking whether it is the ‘future’ of food. The broadcaster posted a short video outlining what lab meat is – and why it could be an essential development. Clean meat – known as lab, bio, or cultured meat – is built using animal cells. Some scientists also use foetal blood plasma harvested from unborn calves (though some brands say they have developed technology to avoid this). Clean meat is therefore not vegan, though some vegans choose to support the concept, as it has the potential to reduce the number of animals slaughtered for food. According to the film: “The meat we eat and the way we farm it is being scrutinised more than ever, from greenhouse gas emissions and overfishing to animal welfare concerns. So some companies are looking at alternatives.” The film references Silicon Valley companies Memphis Meats and Hampton Creek. The first has created cultured chicken and a meatball – but the prohibitive cost ($18,000 per pound) means there is some work to do before it goes mainstream. Hampton Creek recently revealed it had been working on growing cultured meat – and intends to bring it to market next year. Mike Seldon is Co-founder of San Francisco start-up Fishless Foods, which is working on creating cultured fish. He claims a single cell can theoretically create a whole ton of fish, making the mission an important one. Seldon says: “Fish demand is rising but the production can’t go any higher – 52 per cent of all fisheries are fully exploited, 25 per cent above that are in collapse, they are over-exploited. “So we only have 23 per cent of the world’s fisheries that we can use to increase production. So if we still want to eat fish at the rate we are eating it, we have to do this.” But according to Seddon there is a major stumbling block. “When I walk into a room at any sort of conference I can see in people’s eyes, ‘oh this is the next big evil corporation that’s going to put things in my food that I don’t understand’,” he says. “And so one of my main missions is to talk to people and to really make them understand that we are people, we are environmentalists, we are conservationists and we are on the same team.” The other big problem the Fishless Foods team is working to overcome is the use of calf foetus blood in stem cell growth – the duo wants to create an alternative which is both animal-free and more cost effective.

This would mean its product would come to market earlier than any of its competitors’, which include California-based startup Memphis Meats – which aims to bring its ‘clean meat’ to stores in 2021, and Netherlands-based Mosa Meats, which was set up by Dr Mark Post – one of the cultured meat scene’s most prominent voices, who created a lab-grown burger in 2013. A range of high tech meat-alternatives are currently becoming available to consumers – either via retail outlets or restaurants. Impossible Foods’ ‘bleeding’ burger made from plant proteins and vegan ‘heme’ is believed to be one of the most authentically ‘meat-like’ plant-based product, and is available in some eateries in the States. Beyond Meat sells some of its pea protein-based meat-alternatives at a range of US retailers. Cultured meat is created from the cells of an animal – unlike these products which are entirely plant-based. Hampton Creek – which is worth more than $1 billion – has faced its fair share of controversy in recent times. Earlier this week major retailer Target removed all the start-up’s products from its shelves among safety concerns (though these allegations are as yet unsubstantiated. The company also hit headlines when giant corporation Unilever tried to sue the brand for violating truth-in-labeling laws, saying that mayonnaise must contain eggs.  As a vegan products, Hampton Creek’s product is eggless. Despite this, Unilever went on to drop the lawsuit. Hampton Creek also gained the attention of the mainstream press in recent weeks, after an alleged coup plot, which resulted in the dismissal of three senior staff members. What impact could the widespread availability of cultured meat have? Bruce Friedrich is Executive Director of the Good Food Institute [GFI] – an organization that supports meat-alternative companies. He says: “Once we have clean meat that is cost-competitive with animal-based meat, that will be the beginning of the end of all the harms of industrial agriculture.” Paul Shapiro, Vice President of Policy at the Humane Society of the United States – and author of a forthcoming book on meat alternatives – adds: “The fact that Hampton Creek has so many resources at its fingertips is very promising for speeding up the commercialization of clean meat.” Bruce Friedlich says the GFI is ‘confident’ Hampton Creek can meet its 2018 goal. “It’s an ambitious goal for sure, but yes, with the right resources, it should be achievable,” he says.  “Hampton Creek has gone beyond expectation with everything it has set out to do — it went from founding to unicorn status in about five years.  “[CEO] Joshua Tetrick appears to be committed to moving fast and breaking things.” 4 Vegan Start-Ups Set To Change The World Building Meat From Plants: Interview With Beyond Meat Plant-Based Impossible Burger Now Available At Popular Burger Chain "
8996,EU Bosses Told: Shift Towards Veganism Must Be ‘Urgent Policy Priority’,https://plantbasednews.org/culture/eu-bosses-told-shift-towards-veganism-must-be-urgent-policy-priority/,2017-08-06,"EU policy makers have been told the only way to tackle climate change, improve consumer health and protect animal welfare is to encourage a shift away from meat-heavy diets and towards plant-based foods. This should be an urgent priority, according to a number of Members of the European Parliament who joined forces with experts from industry, research and innovation to call upon the EU to implement big changes. Spanish MEP Florent Marcellesi said: “If we want to combat climate change, improve our health and ensure animal welfare, the big challenge is to reduce meat consumption in Europe by five.  “That means something as simple as being aware that it is not necessary to eat animal protein every day. In addition to a profound change in production, the future inevitably passes through a cultural change in our diet, gradually replacing the intake of animal protein by vegetable.  “There are many alternatives nowadays that substitute the meat, and that make possible this transition towards a world more respectful of the climate, our health and the animals.” EU citizens account for approximately seven percent of the world’s population, but are responsible for a massive 16 percent of the world’s meat consumption, consuming four or five times more animal products than people in less wealthy regions.  Speakers, including experts from Humane Society International, Plant Meat Matters, the Green Protein Alliance, the FOOD 2030 Sector at the European Commission’s Directorate General for Research and Innovation, Forum for the Future and several MEPs, called on the EU to lead the transition to plant-based proteins. Alexandra Clark, Humane Society International’s Europe’s sustainable food campaigner, said: “Affordable, healthier plant-based products which taste like meat but have a lower environmental impact are already on the market. More will be launched soon. The European Commission should support the production and promotion of these greener products.” Animal agriculture is a top contributor to some of the most pressing ecological crises of our time, including climate change, and it is estimated to be responsible for up to 17 percent of the EU’s human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.  Raising such large numbers of animals, in predominantly intensive systems, harms the environment, as well as human health and animal welfare. Public health studies clearly show that a shift to a more plant-based diet significantly reduces instances of obesity and chronic disease. Italian MEP Eleonora Evi, said: “I strongly support the consumption of plant-based meat alternatives, provided that their production is socially and environmentally sustainable. We have to go down this path for many reasons.  “Most importantly because we need to curb GHGs emissions from intensive livestock breeding, which is dramatically contributing to climate change and because we need to shift towards a system of production and consumption not based on cruelty to animals, which are sentient beings just like humans.” Plant-based options are beginning to change the way that Europeans eat. Producers of plant-based products designed to mimic some of the flavour, texture and protein characteristics of meat products are targeting the fast growing number of flexitarians and meat reducers.  The products have a predicted global market net worth of just under 6 billion Euros by 2022. As speaker Jeroen Willemsen from the Green Protein Alliance put it: “We are facing a historic ‘Green Protein Big Bang.’ Entrepreneurs seize the opportunity, investors anticipate. In the chaos that will follow, governments need to step in.” Dr Karen Fabbri, Head of Sector of the European Commission’s FOOD 2030, acknowledged the need to shift to more sustainable diets, saying “We know we need to invest in alternative proteins, including plant-based proteins, to improve health and sustainability.” German MEP Stefan Eck, concluded: “In the face of the environmental damage of global industrial meat production systems, shifting towards more plant-based diets in Europe and worldwide is the best we can do for a sustainable future for mankind.  “Plant-based diets use fewer natural resources, are healthier and more respectful of animals. The future Common Agriculture Policy should take these facts into consideration.” "
9102,The Best Way To Help Animals Might Surprise You,https://plantbasednews.org/opinion/the-best-way-to-help-animals-might-not-be-what-you-think/,2017-11-03,"In
factory farms, as many as thousands of animals can be squeezed into a single
building. Nowhere to move, they often suffer injury from immobility and turn on
each other. Profit is maximised by breeding animals to grow as fast as
possible, often resulting in physical abnormalities. By the time they reach
maturity, many chickens can’t even stand. Using
animals for food causes suffering on an immense scale. Each year, hundreds of
billions of aquatic animals are killed by commercial fishing and farming – some
estimates place the number of animals affected at over 1 trillion. The number of land
animals raised for food is now over 70 billion and continues to grow. Some 99% of animals raised in the US are from factory farms, and
experience unimaginable suffering. When I — and likely you
— look at these figures, I feel compelled to help every last animal in need. An
easy and impactful way to make a difference to animals is of course to go
vegan, an act estimated to spare as many as hundreds of animals from factory farming or death each year. But
what else can you do once you’ve gone vegan? The sad truth is that we simply
don’t have the time and resources to help everyone, at least not all at once. The
good news is that we can help more than you probably think through
rigorous research and careful decision-making. Estimates suggest donations to
the right charities of just a few dollars — less than the price of a cup of
coffee — can spare dozens of animals from this horrific suffering. But how do
we know what to do to have the most impact? Luckily, many people are
thinking about this question. Effective altruism is a
global movement of individuals and organisations working to make the most
positive difference they can in the lives of humans and non-human animals.
Whether you’re thinking about which charity to give to, the best way to
volunteer your time, or where to find a fulfilling and meaningful career, it’s
easy to drop your head into your hands, overwhelmed by all the opportunities.
Effective altruism tries to help people like you make these tough decisions
through evidence-based, thoughtful analysis. Animal Charity Evaluators researches animal charities to estimate
their impact on the lives of animals. They publish an annual list of Top Charities based on what the evidence says about their
cost-effectiveness. Currently the top three recommendations are the Good Food Institute, Mercy for Animals, and
the Humane League. The Good Food Institute helps develop
plant-based and cultured meat alternatives to animal agriculture by providing
strategic and technical support to food tech companies. Mercy for Animals and
the Humane League conduct outreach and campaigning — including undercover
investigations in the case of MFA — to inspire diet and policy change. As an example of the kind of impact these charities have, ACE estimates that a $1,000 USD donation to Mercy for Animals will result in sparing -10,000 to 80,000 animals from a life in industrial agriculture. Of course there is much uncertainty in any such estimate, but even
such rough calculations suggest we can do a huge amount of good with modest
donations. ACE also researches
specific interventions to help animals including leafleting, online
ads and corporate outreach. Their results can be useful for organisations and
individuals deciding how best to use their time. Another effective
altruist organization working to help animals is Sentience Politics, an
antispeciesist political think tank. Their activities include writing policy
papers to share with politicians on animal issues, running ballot initiatives
to implement animal-friendly policies, and hosting conferences to bring
effective altruists together. 80,000 Hours exists to help people choose careers that
bring them the most satisfaction and make the biggest difference. They offer a
range of services to assist with choosing and achieving the best careers such
as written and video guides, and one-on-one coaching. You can find their review
on what to do about factory farming here. However you decide to
help animals, whether it’s by working for an effective organisation, donating
to evidence-based causes, or working at a grassroots level, we can all agree
that their suffering is too great not to think critically about the best ways
to help them. We must also remain open to the possibility that our current
approach needs to shift direction. We have a remarkable opportunity to make
such a huge difference, and the animals deserve nothing less. "
9208,"Aleph Farms: “Our Vision is to Lead the Global Food System Transition Toward a More Sustainable, Equitable, and Secure World”",https://vegconomist.com/interviews/aleph-farms-our-vision-is-to-lead-the-global-food-system-transition-toward-a-more-sustainable-equitable-and-secure-world/,2021-07-21,"Cell-cultured steak producer Aleph Farms has always been at the forefront of the cell-cultured meat movement. The Israeli pioneers recently announced a highly impressive $105 million Series B funding round with some extremely interesting participants. Whether it be producing the first cultivated beef steak back in 2018, or the first cultivated thick-cut ribeye steak in 2021, Aleph Farms has strived to push the envelope for the emerging market – it even grew the first cultivated meat in space in 2019. Following such a list of recent developments, it was time to catch up again with Didier Toubia, Co-Founder and CEO of Aleph Farms to discuss the company’s role at the forefront of cell-cultured meat. Congratulations on completing your Series B funding round. What does such a hugely significant raise say about investor confidence in Aleph Farms and the cell-cultured meat industry?
Thank you. This raise certainly speaks to investors’ confidence in Aleph Farms, but it also speaks to our confidence in them. We see our investors as partners for building this new category of cultivated meat. It was critical to us that our investors share our strong commitment to improving the sustainability of our global food systems. This fundraise demonstrates that cultivated meat is quickly becoming a reality. It is not a long-term vision anymore, but rather a practical solution to the world’s most urgent issues today. It represents the ongoing process of bringing cultivated meat products to global markets. The round was co-led by DisruptAD, part of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign fund. How important is it to establish partnerships with states and governments?
It’s critical that there is an inclusive transition to a more sustainable and resilient meat sector and governments play an important role. DisruptAD’s investment in Aleph Farms will help bolster Abu Dhabi’s long-term focus on food resilience. As a strategic partner to DisruptAD, we will evaluate the establishment of a manufacturing facility in Abu Dhabi to supply our cultivated meat products across the UAE and the broader GCC region. The Emirates have shown that one of the region’s central goals, includes supporting the transition towards sustainable and resilient food production systems. We see food security as a potential cornerstone for creating regional collaboration and stability in the region. As food security is a challenge that all countries in the Middle East face, collaborating on solutions like cultivated meat can provide means for long-standing peace in this region. Aleph’s food security vision is about producing quality meat locally for anyone, anytime, anywhere, even in the most remote areas that are impacted by climate change the most. Climate affects agriculture and vice versa, so they are deeply interconnected. The effect of climate change on agriculture goes a long way to increase or decrease food security and invariably food nutrition through its impacts on agricultural lands. This is because the more food insecurity there is, the more issues of undernutrition are observed. According to new studies by CE Delft, cultivated meat could use up to 95% less land and 78% less water compared to conventional beef production. This data on the projected environmental footprint of cultivated meat, emphasizes its role in providing the global world population with quality, and delicious meat, independently of climate or availability of natural resources. The funding included major players in the meat industry, such as Thai Union and Cargill. What does the involvement of the meat and seafood industry signify to you about the future of meat and the direction of such players?
Our strategy is to integrate into the existing ecosystem as part of our go-to-market plans, serving as the driver of an inclusive transition of the meat sector towards sustainability and resilience. Leveraging the expertise and infrastructure of leading food and meat companies will drive a faster scale-up of cultivated meat and eventually lead to a broader positive impact. These partnerships fulfil our vision, which is to lead the global food system transition toward a more sustainable, equitable, and secure world. We have announced MoUs until now with Mitsubishi Corporation in Japan and BRF in Brazil, in a step that will accelerate these countries’ goals of becoming robust, food self-sufficient and climate-neutral global leaders. Cargill and M-Industry–the industrial group of Migros are also investors in the company. Along with Singapore, Israel is leading the way as an epicentre of cell-cultured meat development and investment. Do you see a future where cell-cultured meat is a normal part of family dinners in Israel or any other part of the world?
Yes. A recent consumer study we commissioned that was published on May 11, 2021 by the peer-reviewed journal, Foods, has affirmed that cultivated meat is likely to make up a major part of consumers’ future diets. US and UK respondents, on average, imagined that cultivated meat could make up about 40% of their future meat intake, with conventional meat constituting around 60%. The study also showed patterns of greater openness to trying cultivated meat by younger generational groups: 87-89% of Gen Z adults, 84-85% of Millennials, 76-77% of Gen X, and 70-74% of Boomers were at least somewhat open to trying cultivated meat. Segmentation of the participants by age and by degree of enthusiasm, 40% of consumers were “very” or “extremely likely” to try cultivated meat in both the US and the UK. This group of enthusiastic triers was categorized as the “early majority” group. Of the early majority group, an overwhelming 98-99% of them said they would consider welcoming it as a regular item in their shopping basket. The vast majority of the early majority are omnivores (94-95%) who consume meat 2-3 times per day in a typical week. What will be the short-term impact of the recent investment for Aleph Farms?
Near-term milestones include scaling-up manufacturing, growing operations internationally, and expanding its product lines and technology platform ahead of Aleph Farms’ initial market launch in 2022. The company is currently working with regulatory agencies on its plans for market entry. In the longer term, what will be the biggest milestones for the company over the coming years?
Our long-term vision is to provide unconditional access to high quality nutrition to anyone, anytime, anywhere. One of the big challenges of cultivated meat is the ability to produce large quantities efficiently at a cost that is in line with the meat industry. Overall, we have developed five different technologies that are unique to Aleph Farms which are put into a proprietary large-scale production process and patented by the company. Building trust with consumers is paramount and central to our strategy. From our Community Center to extensive market surveys around the world, we listen to consumers and provide transparency into our business practices and production methodology. Through research we’re currently conducting, we’re gaining insights regarding our target demographic that will further inform our marketing strategy.    "

Investors included SOSV, Zero Carbon Capital, and MarinyaCapital.  Multus is working on animal-free replacements for the growth media used to produce cell-cultured meat. The animal serum-based growth media currently used by many companies is expensive and has ethical issues, and these factors have held back the industry. With the help of the new funding, Multus will be able to bring its first product to market. The product will be known as Proliferum M™, and according to Multus it will “allow companies to grow cost–competitive cultivated meat products as a viable alternative to industrial farming.” Consumers are increasingly open to the idea of cell-cultured meat. A study conducted earlier this year found that on average, people expect it to make up 40% of their future meat intake. Over 70% of people said they were at least somewhat open to trying it. But a report earlier this year found that reducing costs would be key to creating a global cell-cultured meat industry. If successful, the industry could be worth $25 billion by 2030. “Through developing a replacement for expensive, animal–derived feed ingredients, Multus aims to use its technology to enable cultivated meat companies to make their products the sustainable and affordable choice for everyone,” the company said in a press release.

Always display content from YouTube Elysabeth:  Ultimately, as we have more people on the planet-we are going from 7.6 billion people to 9.8 billion people- but we’re not getting more land and we’re not getting more water, countries might not be so willing to share and trade food with each other.  If you don’t have control over your own food supply, you really don’t have global political power.  It just to me seems that if I were a politician, I would be on top of that. So I look at Israel and I see that beautiful triangle they have between government, education, the largest educational institutions, and entrepreneurs. And we’re not really forming that here and I wondered if either of you would like to comment. Caroline Bushnell: Alternative proteins provide a solution to these major global challenges from food security to climate change to global hunger. I mean, these are the things that governments exist to address so we do expect that we will see more government investment in alternative proteins and do hope that that model that you just spoke about is replicated in more countries as this is such a pressing issue. And it’s a focus area for GFI right now, really calling on the US government to put more investment into research and development in alternative proteins and there are some promising indicators there. You mentioned Israel, but there are several other countries that have already put millions into these technologies and do largely look at this from a food security standpoint. We are calling on the government to do that and our policy team is starting to see some interest from several US policy makers that they are working with on this front both at the state and the federal level. Julie Emmett: You know, we’ve, up until this point, generally been defending bills and now we’re all becoming more proactive with proactive policies to be able to get the research needed to be able to grow and to even the playing field which is all you can ask for, right? So, I think it’s really exciting, the developments that we’re seeing in all of those areas. Elysabeth: Yes, and it is such a large conversation.  It’s an existential one really. I was speaking at the UN Global Compact Leader Summit recently about farmers and how plant-based foods can be a solution for them as well as we look for better opportunities to farm and more opportunities for farmers and more equity in the whole food process. So, you know, one of the strange stats is that the people who actually make our food, globally around the world, those who are picking the food etc., they’re the people who have the least access to food. So, there’s this whole inequity throughout the food system globally. It was exciting to speak there and it’s exciting that they were open to hearing how plant-based could be a solution. So, these are exciting times in that people are starting to open up to the message in a way even a year ago I was having trouble having these conversations with people.

The startup recently closed a $10 million (€8.4 million) funding round as it positions itself in the emerging cell-cultured poultry market. “The ambition is that in many places cultivated foie gras not only will be the best option, but it will be the only option” From chicken to duck, poultry is the planet’s most consumed meat, so Gourmey has focused on this sector, starting with its ethical foie gras but with one eye on a future mass-marketable chicken fillet. Its recent funding round featured Big Idea Ventures and Beyond Investing, as well as public backing from Bpifrance and the European Commission. With this investment, the company plans to create its pilot production line in Paris, with expectations to sell its foie gras products in late 2022 or early 2023. French delicacy foie gras is banned from shelves in some countries due to the brutal cruelty of its production, though it remains a staple for special occasions in French culture. It is the perfect product for cell-cultured production as the fatty smoothness it is known for is easily produced, compared to the complexity of multiple fibers and textures necessary in other cultivated meats. In addition, as foie gras is a luxury, high-cost product, Gourmey is confident it can reach price parity more quickly than other cheaper, mass-produced meats. “We’re at three-figures range per kilogram and need to go to the two-figures range. We are on our way to decreasing production cost by 40X in the next months,” explained co-founder and CEO Nicolas Morin-Forest to Bloomberg. “We really want to take cultivated meat into our gastronomy, and we believe chef adoption will essentially be the best label on cultivated-meat products,” Morin-Forest continued. “The ambition is that in many places cultivated foie gras not only will be the best option, but it will be the only option.”    "
9248,“This Could Be Transformative” – The GFI Responds to Nestlé Entering Cultivated Meat Sector,https://vegconomist.com/cell-cultured/this-could-be-transformative-the-gfi-responds-to-nestle-entering-cultivated-meat-sector/,2021-07-14,"Following the news as we reported earlier today that Nestlé has confirmed they are currently working on cell-cultured meat; The Good Food Institute (GFI) Founder and President Bruce Friedrich has said that the development could be transformative for the sustainable protein industry and the global food system. “It appears that Nestlé is positioning itself to be the first global food giant to market with a hybrid plant-based and cultivated meat product. Nestlé’s involvement at this level could be transformative for the cultivated meat industry and should significantly advance what needs to be a global norm: delivering more sustainable proteins to consumers around the world,” said Friedrich. “Nestlé is the world’s biggest food company, so this level of validation sends an unmistakable signal of the huge potential the company sees in the future of the cultivated meat industry. An investment like this from the global food leader could propel the industry forward and mainstream the idea of cultivating real animal meat from cells,” he said. “Nestlé is one of the most well-known brands on the planet, so it is exciting to see the company reimagining meat. When Nestlé talks, the worldwide food industry listens. For Nestlé to see the potential of cultivating real animal meat directly from cells would be a game-changer for the industry.” Nestlé Israel CEO Avi Ben Assayag recently told Israeli business magazine Globes: “We must reinvent the future of nutrition. We can’t go on with the slaughtering and milking of cows. […] If we don’t create a science-based industrial agriculture revolution, we won’t be able to feed the world.” GFI’s Cultivated Meat State of the Industry report shows that 2020 was a record year, with 23 new cultivated meat companies launching for a total of 76 companies globally – up 43% from 2019. Cultivated meat companies received more than $360 million in investments in 2020, which is six times the amount raised in 2019. Recent studies show that – compared with conventional beef – meat cultivated directly from cells may cause up to 92% less global warming and 93% less air pollution and use up to 95% less land and 78% less water. Despite these positive developments, public funding remains critical. Global governments invest more than $30 billion every year into renewable energy research and development but have not yet meaningfully prioritized climate-essential methods of producing protein. Cultivated meat will remain just a fraction of the overall market for conventional meat unless governments invest in alternative proteins as they’ve done for other climate-friendly innovations. “Globally, we need a protein transition if we’re going to move the world to net-zero emissions,” said Friedrich. “We need both the public and private sector to go all-in on making meat from plants and cultivating meat from cells. Governments must invest in these innovations now to slash the climate impact of our food system and stand a chance of moving the world to net-zero emissions by 2050.”    "

Having raised €550,000, the Wageningen-based startup will scale up production and accelerate its market entry. “Alternative protein sources are abundant, but the importance of the fat element has been overlooked” TTM creates unsaturated fat ingredients that are significantly healthier than the saturated fats currently used in many products. The startup has developed technology that extracts fat droplets from seeds, such as sunflower seeds, for sustainable production of fat that is texturally similar to milk. A spin-off of Wageningen University & Research, TTM uses European seeds to improve sustainability and claims a significant improvement in mouthfeel and creaminess profiles. It believes itself to be well-positioned as a B2B supplier for the rapidly-growing alt dairy market, as fat has become a hot topic in the plant-based world, with many considering it the key to taking the industry to the next level. “We are currently still using palm oil in many dairy alternatives. The palm oil must be transported from afar, and its production leads to deforestation of the tropical rainforests. Our technology allows us to produce small globules of fat (oleosomes) from the seeds of European sunflowers, thus offering a locally produced alternative,” explained Dimitris Karefyllakis, CEO and co-founder of TTM. “Creaminess comes from fat, not protein. Alternative protein sources are abundant, but the importance of the fat element has been overlooked. Without this, there will be no protein transition,” he added.    "

In Tune With the Times: Leading International Trade Fair IFFA to Showcase Processing Tech For Alt Proteins",https://vegconomist.com/fairs-and-events/sponsored-post-in-tune-with-the-times-leading-international-trade-fair-iffa-to-showcase-processing-tech-for-alt-proteins/,2021-07-11," Looking to the future and with an eye on potential development; IFFA, the long-established leading trade fair for the global meat industry, will be opening up to alternative proteins from 2022. A quite clear objective: to become the top event in the international protein industry. “Plantbased products as a topic are not new at the IFFA; over the past years, however, the increasing desire on the part of consumers for alternative products to meat and fish has given it a boost”
– Wolfgang Marzin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Messe Frankfurt GmbH “The procedures and techniques for the processing and packaging of meat goods and of alternative protein products are very similar. So for us it is a logical step to open the IFFA up to these products. I am quite sure that the protein industry will benefit from the expertise and drive to innovation of the businesses represented at the IFFA. And, vice versa, our exhibitor firms will meet new customer groups – and thus new leads.” Modern plant technology, as showcased at the IFFA, can make a major contribution to raising the production of vegan products, reducing costs and increasing food security. An important subject, since plantbased foods are subject to deterioration, often even more so than animal-based products. The top themes at IFFA 2022 will be relevant to the whole food industry. One of the most important will be that of automation and optimisation of production in the food industry. An equally major role will be played by specific, results-oriented strategies for more sustainability – in this context energy efficiency, the capacity to save and recycle packaging material and a reduction in food waste are vital areas of innovation. New packaging designs and trends in products, ingredients and flavourings are likewise in focus. Moreover, complementary programme events are in planning, directed precisely to international trade visitors from the meat-replacement products sector. Jointly with its partners, such as the BALPRo, the Association for Alternative Protein Sources, Messe Frankfurt is working on attractive formats and contents. Fabio Ziemßen, chairman of BALPRo, explains: “So we can demonstrate the full potential of alternative protein sources and make them available to the conventional meat industry, we are looking forward to working jointly with Messe Frankfurt at the IFFA.” IFFA, Technology for Meat and Alternative Proteins, will be taking place from 14 to 19 May 2022 in Frankfurt am Main. The last time this international trade fair was held, over 1,000 exhibitors from 49 countries showcased their innovations to a trade public of some 66,000 visitors. The IFFA is the global trade-fair highlight: 70 percent of the visitors and 63 percent of the businesses exhibiting come from abroad. Further information at: www.iffa.com    "

The first cell-cultured meat company to be publicly listed has expanded R&D activities to focus on cell lines and technologies for future mass production of slaughter-free pork, alongside its current lines of beef and chicken.  “Our goal is to lead the upcoming agricultural revolution by making tomorrow’s meat safe, plentiful and sustainable” After recently submitting a patent application in the US for its 3D bioprinting technology, MeaTech 3D is pursuing porcine cellular agriculture as pork is currently the most consumed meat across the globe. The pork meat market is estimated to be worth $20 billion annually in the US alone. Initial R&D activities will focus on developing stable porcine cell lines which will have the potential to initiate cultivated pork biomass production capabilities. MeaTech aims to develop the technology to produce end-products, as well as licensing its technologies to customers along the meat and alt protein supply chain, such as value-added food processors and premier food brands. MeaTech listed on the TASE in 2019 and the company also listed on Nasdaq in March 2021. The company also recently announced its plans to establish a pilot plant in 2022 to produce cultured chicken fat for industry collaborations.  “Our goal is to lead the upcoming agricultural revolution by making tomorrow’s meat safe, plentiful and sustainable. MeaTech is developing a broad range of cultured meat technologies, developing potential alternatives to conventional factory farming of beef, chicken and now, pork,” stated MeaTech CEO Sharon Fima. “We believe that offering additional cultivated meat product lines can widen our addressable markets, generating additional revenue potential. Our goal is to be similar in all respects to livestock-farmed pork, while offering a significantly more sustainable and slaughter-free production method,” Fima added.    "

9310,Venture Science: Unlocking the Mysteries of Fats as Key to a Sustainable Food System,https://vegconomist.com/food-and-beverage/venture-science-unlocking-the-mysteries-of-fats-as-key-to-a-sustainable-food-system/,2021-07-01,"Recent research published by Credit Suisse concluded that consumers are unlikely to make a full conversion to a vegan diet because processed foods are simply too tasty. Phil Morle, Partner at Main Sequence, the VC founded by CSIRO, the Australian Government agency responsible for scientific research, explains that we need to find a way to tap into people’s desire to eat more sustainably without sacrificing taste.  “The plant-based food industry is not going anywhere, and will be foundational to creating a more sustainable food system. According to a new report by BCG and Blue Horizon, alternative proteins could make up around 22% of the overall protein market by 2035 and by 2035 we could see one-tenth of all meat, eggs, and dairy consumed globally coming from alternative food sources. Reforming the way we produce and consume food has never been more important. With the global population expected to grow to 10 billion by 2050, and food-related emissions contributing over 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions (a figure we can only expect to see grow), building a sustainable food system is critical. Investment and innovation need to go hand in hand if we are to respond to the challenges of tomorrow. Australia is already making great strides towards building a resilient and sustainable food system. The labs, scientific talent and agriculture know-how are at our fingertips, making it likely Australia’s agriculture, scientific and business communities will come together to rise to the challenges of tomorrow. But as the plant-based and alt-protein industry continue to grow, there will be one issue that continues to stand in its way — making plant-based foods taste like the real thing. And the reason why is fats. Imagine cooking without fats, without the flavours and textures that fats make possible. Food wouldn’t be nearly as enjoyable. This is the problem the alt-protein food industry is facing, and until we are able to make animal-free fats there is only so far the industry can go. This is why companies such as Nourish Ingredients, who are working to unlock the mysteries of fats and create animal-free fats, are essential for the future of the industry. When it comes to the plant-based industry, fats are the final frontier if we want to deliver alt-food without the alt-experience. In order to solve this global challenge, we need a new approach to innovation — an approach that thinks problem first, and takes the best in breakthrough science and the entrepreneurial spirit of founders, to create the next global giants that can solve our great planetary challenges. This approach is Venture Science, and it has the power to solve our biggest problems. Instead of hearing pitches from founders with an idea, the Venture Science deal creation model starts by identifying a great challenge and a global opportunity, then assembling the science capability to tackle it, introducing a pathway into market through a leading industry player, and injecting venture investment to create a brand new company. It’s the model that gave birth to Australian plant-based meat champion v2food and an animal-free dairy company that we will be announcing soon. Every problem you want to solve has at least the seed of a solution and it is happening right now in the research labs of the world. Venture Science brings these seeds and capital together and accelerates them with the unfair advantage of industry. The combined force of entrepreneurship and science has the potential to deliver solutions at scale to the planet.” Special guest contribution from Phil Morle, Partner at Main Sequence Main Sequence has been heavily involved in the development of the plant-based industry in Australia and has backed v2food, Clara Foods and Nourish Ingredients. Main Sequence was central to v2’s 2-year journey from an idea to commercialisation.    "

The animal-free gelatin could address some of the issues with conventional gelatin production, such as contamination and inconsistent quality between batches. It also has a carbon footprint 50 times lower than animal gelatin, and Provenance says it will be improving the efficiency of production to decrease the environmental impact even further. The gelatin was developed from another of Provenance’s products, its animal-free collagen. Most types of synthetic collagen on the market are extremely expensive, but Provenance says it is working to bring costs down to under $15 per kilogram and hopes to soon achieve price parity with the conventional variety. It is already partnering with several companies that are interested in switching the collagen they use to a vegan alternative. The development of cruelty-free alternatives to animal proteins is a growing area, with Clara Foods recently announcing it had made vegan pepsin. Meanwhile, Avant is working on cell-cultured collagen, and Jellatech is also producing both collagen and gelatin using cellular agriculture. “We had been working on making gelatin in the lab for quite a while, so it was very exciting when we saw that we were able to make gelatins from our full-length type one collagens.

Dr Guy Sandelowsky and Shiv Sivakumar founded Omni during the COVID-19 pandemic and are now preparing to launch their first line of products. Dr. Guy points out that “some of the longest living dogs on record were fed entirely plant-based diets” and that this is “hardly surprising” considering that these diets are often made up of “clean protein, healthy fats, and are rich in vitamins and minerals”. Omni is part of the current cohort at the ProVeg Incubator. As part of our series on this cohort, we spoke to Guy and Shiv about Omni’s journey and their plans for the future. Introduce yourself and your mission
I started omni, named after the fact that dogs are omnivores and can derive their nutrition from a variety of plant-based sources, with former investment banker and dog lover Shiv Sivakumar. Shiv grew up in Sri Lanka, where dogs have been thriving on plant-based diets for generations. The sad truth is that one in four dogs in the UK will get cancer and one in two suffer from obesity. Humans started giving up various kinds of processed meats decades ago because of the proven links to cancer and obesity, yet these meats are still the main component of most dog foods. What’s more, the world’s 500 million dogs and cats are estimated to eat 20% of the world’s meat. That’s the equivalent environmental impact of 13.6 million cars. Dogs are increasingly treated as members of the family and as humans try to cut back on their meat consumption for health and environmental reasons, it’s now possible to do the same for dogs. In my clinic, I see dogs that are getting cancer so much younger than they should be, while others are so obese that they struggle with their breathing and mobility. It’s a real shame. Tell us about your product
After a year of research, and over 20 recipe iterations, we have developed a delicious, high protein plant-based food for dogs. Omni products were formulated by some of the world’s leading veterinary nutritionists and they are approved by FEDIAF (the European regulatory body). The result is that omni’s dog food is 100% nutritionally complete and balanced.” Guy and Shiv have both tried the food themselves and comment on the fact that it’s “all good stuff that you or I would want to eat too”. The ingredients include peas, lentils, brown rice, and pumpkin. “What’s not to love?”, says Guy. “At 30% protein content, there is also more protein in omni food than most other meat-based dog food diets”. One point that is vital is that omni food should not just be healthy and sustainable, but also absolutely delicious. Just because a dog is not eating meat, doesn’t mean that they should miss out on flavour. Omni’s taste-test trial with over 500 dog parents was phenomenal; it showed that 91% of dogs love omni and that half of the dogs actually preferred it to meat-based food! In addition, omni produces 85% less greenhouse gas emissions, consumes 61% less water, and uses 92% less land, compared to the production of conventional meat-based dog food. At what stage is your company currently?
Having conducted early taste trials, which received glowing reviews from dog owners and dogs (lots of tail wagging, bowl licking, and drooling), we are now preparing to launch our dog food for sale in the next couple of months. Products will be available for purchase through our website and people can sign up now to get early access and exclusive discounts. We’ve also started to establish relationships with vet practices in the UK and they will start to stock omni from next month (July 2021). What are your plans for the next five years?
We hope that all dog parents will feel empowered to feed their dogs omni, even if it forms part of a diet that also includes some meat or fish-based products. As we grow, we plan to expand our range and offer wet food, treats, and supplements. We will start by selling throughout Europe and then look towards Asia — where there is already a growing demand for alternative protein dog food products. However big we get though, we will always stay true to our values of science-backed nutrition, rooted in our love for dogs.    "

9354,Study Reveals That Consumers Want Animal-Free Cheese & Alt Dairy is Set to Immediately Disrupt $240Bn Cheese Market,https://vegconomist.com/studies-and-numbers/study-reveals-consumers-want-animal-free-cheese-alt-dairy-is-set-to-immediately-disrupt-240bn-cheese-market/,2021-06-24,"Despite precision-fermentation-made animal-free cheese not yet hitting the mass market, the first-ever large-scale study of consumer acceptance for animal-free cheese has revealed that such products will immediately challenge conventional dairy in the $240 billion cheese market. The response was overwhelmingly favourable for precision fermentation-made animal-free dairy, with 71% of respondents willing to buy and 79% willing to try. Precision-fermentation company Formo and the University of Bath co-published the study, having surveyed 5,054 individuals from Brazil, Germany, India, the UK, and the USA. The study reveals strong consumer enthusiasm for animal-free cheese across various countries, age groups, as well as dietary preferences. Crucially, these products have mass-market potential far beyond the vegan category, with the recent study showing flexitarians to have the highest levels of enthusiasm. By inserting a copied stretch of cow DNA, precision fermentation techniques allow microorganisms to produce real milk without animal cruelty. With industrial animal agriculture responsible for 18% of all greenhouse gas emissions, keeping animals out of dairy production is more efficient and beneficial for all. The study confirms that consumers recognize this process as more ethical and sustainable, as conventional cheese production incurs the highest environmental footprint of all animal-based products after red meat. After recently rebranding from former name LegenDairy Foods, Germany’s Formo develops bioidentical, animal-free milk proteins with the same taste, functionality, and nutrition profile as conventional animal-based cheeses. The study found higher levels of consumer dissatisfaction with plant-based cheese, and that consumers perceived precision-fermentation-made animal-free cheese as offering a significantly better taste profile. “Just as we have seen plant-based milk taking an increasing share of the milk market in recent years, we now see that consumers are ready for a new kind of animal-free dairy cheese product,” stated Christopher Bryant, PhD, of the University of Bath. “Seeing the growing consumer groups of flexitarians and young people driving adoption of animal-free cheese is a big indicator that these products will appeal to consumers far beyond the niche markets of current vegan cheese”. “We’re hearing loud and clear that consumers are ready to embrace animal-free dairy products”, explained Raffael Wohlgensinger, Co-Founder & CEO at Formo. “There’s never been a better time to ask ourselves what we want from our food system and it’s now that politicians should support sustainable innovation like precision fermentation. Where the future of food is concerned, fast-moving environments like the US and Singapore are starting to become hubs of innovation, so it’s high time politicians here got on board with the potential of alternative proteins through proactive initiatives”.

9355,Interview with Claire Smith on Beyond Impact Vegan Diversity Rolling Fund,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/interview-with-claire-smith-on-beyond-impact-vegan-diversity-rolling-fund/,2021-06-23,"  Pioneering investor in vegan, cruelty-free and animal-replacing products and services Beyond Impact (part of the larger Beyond Investing vegan investment platform) is making its expertise in the selection of high potential and impactful companies available to a wider audience of investors with the launch of its Vegan Diversity Fund, available on the Angellist platform as a Rolling Fund with first close on July 1st 2021. Beyond Impact has been an active investor in this sector since 2017, participating in the earliest rounds of cellular agriculture companies, like Mosa Meat and Blue Nalu, deeptech alternative protein producers, such as Geltor and Clara Foods, and plant-based brands, such has Meatless Farm and Plant Veda. Since its initial seed investments, companies in its portfolio have gone on to raise 100s of millions of dollars, bring innovative animal-free products to market and expand globally. We had the opportunity to sit down with Claire Smith, CIO of Beyond Impact and CEO of Beyond Investing, to find out more about the new fund. Claire, tell us about the name of the fund, firstly why “vegan” ?
The primary purpose of this program, and indeed all of the Beyond Investing investment products, is to accelerate the transition towards a kinder, cleaner, healthier world, for the benefit of people, animals, and the planet. In its latest definition of veganism, the Vegan Society promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives, and the Vegan Diversity Fund will seed and support with further investment those companies whose products replace the use of animals and make it easier and more enjoyable to adopt a vegan lifestyle. Therefore, it is appropriate to describe the fund as “vegan”. And how do you anticipate promoting veganism as a lifestyle through the fund?
As a vegan myself for many years, in common with members of my team, we well understand how a lack of acceptable vegan substitutes is off-putting to people, and how important it is for vegan foods to taste delicious and be convenient and affordable. This is only achieved by providing greater choice to consumers and scaling companies up to a size where they can compete with the food industry majors. This requires money, and, with the growing interest in a plant-based lifestyle and the massive improvements presented by foodtech to create superior and sustainable animal alternatives, the fund aims to spur on veganism through helping entrepreneurs bring more high quality products to market and grow their companies to take more market share and create more impact. And why emphasise “diversity”?
Well our team is majority female and ethnically diverse, and in addition the existing Beyond Impact portfolio has enviable metrics for diversity and inclusion, with almost 50% of firms founded by women, and almost 40% having minority representation in top management. We will continue in the same vein with this new fund, preferentially investing in diverse founding teams, not just for the social impact angle, but because we have found them to be at least as driven, well-qualified, resourceful and hard-working as the standard group of white male founders favored by most venture capital firms. This perception is supported by statistics from studies of successful businesses created and run by women and minorities.  Tell us a bit about the investing background of your team.
The Vegan Diversity Rolling Fund, with its focus on US-based founders, will be managed by myself, in partnership with Tyler Mayoras, who is based in Chicago, and supported by the rest of the Beyond Impact investment team. Prior to directing investment for Beyond Impact, I spent over 30 years in finance and investment at a senior level at leading banks and investment advisory firms. Tyler was until recently a portfolio manager at Advantage Capital Partners, investing in food and agribusiness companies throughout the US, and has himself a 30-year career in finance, private equity and impact investing. He is an active private investor in vegan companies, such as Spero and Lavva, and is the co-founder and CEO of EatCoolBeans, a manufacturer of frozen vegan wraps, and will remain in this position while partnering on this fund. Other members of the Beyond Impact team have expertise in food company operations, industrial manufacturing and impact venture funds. The Vegan Diversity Fund on AngelList has a North American focus – how active has Beyond Impact been as an investor in this region? Tell us a bit more about your current US positions?
Over 1/3 of the portfolio currently advised by Beyond Impact is in companies in the US and Canada, and these include some well-known names, such as the recently listed Plant Veda, a producer of cashew-based creamers and lassis, (ticker “MILK” on the Canadian Securities Exchange). Silicon Valley-based synthetic biology companies Geltor and Clara Foods are replacing animal-derived collagen in cosmetics and animal-derived enzymes and proteins such as those in egg whites in food and industrial products. In 2018 Beyond Impact seeded both San Diego-based Blue Nalu, which is culturing fin fish from cells and upcycled food specialist Renewal Mills, which takes the byproduct of other plant-based food manufacturing, like tofu and oat milk, and creates gluten-free baking mixes. Chicago-based Back of the Yards Algae Sciences, an innovation platform for the development of algal ingredients and anaerobic digestion of food waste, is another example of how Beyond Impact is furthering the future of sustainable food and the circular economy. In the clothing and materials area, Beyond Impact provided seed capital for MINK Shoes, a luxury vegan shoe and accessories brand. Can anyone invest in the new fund? How does the Rolling Fund work in practice?
Investments are accepted by the AngelList platform from US investors who meet the test of accreditation, which is based on annual income, or net worth and AngelList will apply the same tests to any non-US investor who wishes to invest. The Rolling Fund is effectively a series of mini-funds, with the capital inflow in any three-month period funding a group of investments, that investors who put in money over that period will participate in. For this reason, it is recommended that people spread their investments over multiple quarters in order to be more diversified over a larger number of deals, since not all deals will be invested in during a single quarter. More information and a link to subscribe is on AngelList here.  The lists of investments featured above were selected due to their being geographically relevant to the new fund. These lists are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not an exhaustive list of all investments made. A full list of investments is available upon request.            "
9376,AquaCultured Foods is Making Waves as it Unveils “World’s First” Whole Muscle Seafood from Fermentation,https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/aquacultured-foods-is-making-waves-as-it-unveils-worlds-first-whole-muscle-seafood-from-fermentation/,2021-06-21,"As fermentation continues to emerge as the third pillar in the alt protein sphere, one Chicago-based startup has created what it claims to be the first whole muscle seafood alternative through microbial fermentation. AquaCultured Foods has developed novel tech which allows the creation of fungi-based alternative seafood options, from calamari and shrimp to whitefish and tuna. “As the first to create whole cut seafood alternatives via fermentation, the opportunity is almost limitless in the future food landscape” – Anne Palermo, CEO & Co-Founder, AquaCultured Foods Utilizing its own proprietary strain of fungi, AquaCultured Foods creates a bioavailable complete protein, which replicates the texture, appearance, and nutritional profile of fish. The fungi naturally grows in fibrous threads, thus replicating the texture of meat, and crucially without the need of processing. Featuring at this month’s Future Food-Tech Alternative Proteins summit, AquaCultured CEO & Co-Founder Anne Palermo used her experience and knowledge of the sector to identify what she believes is a market white space for whole cut seafood alternatives. “Plant-based seafood is an area that has been notoriously lacking in options. Identifying this lack of supply in spite of the overwhelming global demand has helped us to realize the market white space at hand,” she explained to vegconomist. AquaCultured Foods stresses how its products are grown, rather than processed, allowing them to retain all naturally occurring proteins, fibers, and micronutrients, and avoiding the higher levels of sodium, starches, and isolates often found in plant-based proteins. The startup is in the process of raising $1.5 million to launch up to six SKUs in 1000 outlets, as well as rolling out its Popcorn Shrimp product into foodservice. After having recently featured in the Big Idea Ventures alt protein accelerator program, the company is looking to further its R&D, scale production, and expand its team. “As the first to create whole cut seafood alternatives via fermentation, the opportunity is almost limitless in the future food landscape. Any way that traditional seafood can be used, from raw sashimi to battered and fried popcorn shrimp, our seafood alternatives can be utilized as a 1:1 replacement. Which is helping Aqua Cultured Foods make a truly impactful difference in both protecting our oceans and creating a more sustainable method of food production,” Palermo stated to vegconomist.      "
9382,EU Announces €32M in Funding For Sustainable Protein Research to “Spark Innovation”,https://vegconomist.com/science/eu-announces-e32m-in-funding-for-sustainable-protein-research-to-spark-innovation/,2021-06-18,"EU research and innovation initiative Horizon Europe has announced €32 million in funding for sustainable protein research. The funding will go towards innovation in plant-based, cell-cultured, and fermented alt-meat.  The move comes after pressure from the Good Food Institute Europe, which teamed up with 21 other organisations to send an open letter to the European Commission. The organisations called for more investment in sustainable protein research and development. The sum is the biggest support package Horizon Europe has ever allocated to alt-protein research. It will be broken down into three projects: The EU has previously funded several projects aimed at improving the sustainability of the food system. The FIT4FOOD2030 project developed a “toolbox” to help food system actors improve sustainability, while the PROTEIN2FOOD project aimed to accelerate the transition towards plant-based protein. “Horizon Europe’s funding for open-access research will spark real innovation in plant-based foods, cultivated meat, and fermentation. By making these options more delicious and accessible, and ensuring farmers are part of the transition, this investment will accelerate Europe’s shift to a sustainable, secure, and just food system,” said Acacia Smith, policy manager at the Good Food Institute Europe. She added, “It’s a strong signal that the EU is betting on sustainable proteins playing an important role in meeting its climate and biodiversity targets. National governments should take this as encouragement to invest in the research and infrastructure we need to advance plant-based and cultivated meat.”    "
9388,The GFI’s Bruce Friedrich is Named an “American Food Hero” For His Work in Alt Protein,https://vegconomist.com/society/the-gfis-bruce-friedrich-is-named-an-american-food-hero-for-his-work-in-alt-protein/,2021-06-17,"The Good Food Institute (GFI) Founder and President Bruce Friedrich has been named as a “2021 American Food Hero” in recognition of his work to fundamentally change the food system with alt proteins. EatingWell Magazine has praised Friedrich and the GFI’s work on fighting climate change and reforming food systems in its “American Food Heroes” awards. “Behind the scenes of this surge – everywhere you turn, from advising new companies and funding scientific research to sparking our cultural obsession with meat alternatives – is Bruce Friedrich” – EatingWell Magazine Friedrich founded the international nonprofit over five years ago with the mission of making the global food system better for the planet, people, and animals, with the GFI defining itself with its vision of reimagining meat production. Friedrich’s 2019 TED talk has been viewed over two million times and translated into dozens of languages, while the GFI continues to inform industry and policy with regard to science and solutions globally. The latest accolade shines a light on the popular speaker’s work to advance open-access alternative protein science, including making $7 million available in research grants whilst lobbying governments to fund such research. A case in point is the advocating for $2bn in US federal funds to be directed toward alt protein R&D, as Friedrich and the GFI call on governments to invest in alt proteins as a key climate solution to tackle the increasing risk of pandemics, antibiotic resistance, as well as food insecurity. “While the growth of alternative proteins over the past five years has been promising, the incremental advances made thus far in shifting how meat is made are insufficient,” explained Bruce Friedrich to vegconomist. “The world needs solutions proportional to the magnitude of its challenges. We need food systems and agricultural practices that enable nature to regenerate while protecting global health and food security. Plant-based and cultivated meat represent practical, efficient, and scalable ways to do just that. Governments around the world can lead the way by investing in open-access research and mustering the political will to shift from the status quo.” Political commentators such as the New York Times’ Ezra Klein have joined the call for governments to fund the alt protein sphere as they have done for other innovations and technologies that advance the public good. They argue that – despite surging interest from the private sector – alt proteins will remain just a fraction of the overall market for conventional meat unless governments recognize their huge potential to tackle multiple crises. “What moves us most about this recognition is seeing alternative proteins heralded alongside a diversity of strategies—from migrant farm worker rights and traditional indigenous food systems to new sustainable supply chains and regenerative agriculture certification,” commented GFI Vice President of Communications Sheila Voss. “A transition to alt proteins can and should coexist alongside ‘sister solutions’ that shift global food systems from resource-depleting to resource-replenishing. EatingWell’s 2021 food heroes issue puts faces and names to this same exact point. GFI is honored to be recognized alongside others leading the way in food system transformation.”    "
9389,Cell-Cultured Fish Company Avant Named “Technology Pioneer” by World Economic Forum,https://vegconomist.com/cell-cultured/cell-cultured-fish-company-avant-named-technology-pioneer-by-world-economic-forum/,2021-06-17,"Avant, a Hong Kong company developing cell-cultured fish, has been named as one of the World Economic Forum’s “Technology Pioneers”. The company was recognised for its contributions in the field of Global Public Goods. “We believe a technology-enabled food industry allows more efficient use of natural resources and lands for the growing population on this planet.” Carrie Chan In total, 100 companies from 26 countries on six continents made the list. It focuses on early to growth-stage companies that are expected to have a significant impact on business and society. Following the award, Avant CEO Carrie Chan will be invited to take part in World Economic Forum activities, events, and discussions over the next year. The company will also be able to contribute to WEF initiatives in the next two years, working with global leaders to solve industry and societal issues. “We’re excited to welcome Avant to our 2021 cohort of Technology Pioneers,” said Susan Nesbitt, Head of the Global Innovators Community at the World Economic Forum. “Avant and its fellow pioneers are developing technologies that can help society solve some of its most pressing issues. We look forward to their contribution to the World Economic Forum in its commitment to improving the state of the world.” Back in January, Avant announced a collaboration with leading seafood company VHC to accelerate the commercialisation of its cultivated fish protein. The following month, it said it had created the world’s first cell-cultured collagen for use in skincare products. It also raised $3.1 million in a seed funding round last December. “We are honored to be recognised as a technology pioneer by the World Economic Forum,” said Carrie Chan. “It is an affirmation that our technology is at the forefront of the alternative protein industry. We believe a technology-enabled food industry allows more efficient use of natural resources and lands for the growing population on this planet. We look forward to exchanging knowledge with fellow pioneers on the Forum.”    "
9403,NEXT MEATS: “We Will Apply To Nasdaq and Aim to Be the Fastest In The World From Establishment To Becoming Listed”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/next-meats-we-will-apply-to-nasdaq-and-aim-to-be-the-fastest-in-the-world-from-establishment-to-becoming-listed/,2021-06-15,"Japan’s NEXT MEATS became the first publicly listed plant-based startup in the country, however, the company has lofty ambitions and states it is still far from the corporate philosophy of “saving the earth”. “We are talking with the CEO of a particular US fast-food chain for the launch” Plant-Based Japan Inc. (former freefrom Inc.), a Japanese contributor to vegconomist, interviewed Mr. Ryo Shirai, co-representative of NEXT MEATS, a meat alternative producer steadily showing the fastest growth not just within Japan but in the whole of Asia. It’s been about a year since the company was established. How is the response in Japan so far?
As reported in the previous article, the major supermarket chain Ito-Yokado in Japan has also switched from the initial sales marketing phase to full-scale introduction. The number of stores that have introduced this brand alone has expanded from 10 to more than 100. A mainstream supermarket (*news coming soon), a competitive chain that has stores in other parts of Asia, has decided to handle it nationwide. It is becoming accessible to almost all Japanese consumers. In addition, the introduction of NEXT Gyudon (beef bowl) to IKEA Japan announced on the 18th of May has a considerable influence as an approach to the restaurant sector. How is the response from overseas?
Overseas expansion has been promoted primarily in Asia. We have already partnered up with restaurants such as YAKINIKU LIKE in Taiwan and Singapore, but this is still in the preparatory stage. In addition, as long as we are aware of, preparations for launch are proceeding at a rapid pace in nine countries and regions, including the United States, which will become the main target in the future. “We need an impact that can save the earth” In addition to the current development, it is a remarkable breakthrough with expansion in nine more countries. You emphasized that the leading development destination will be the United States. Could you tell us the reason and its direction in business development?
There are two reasons: the difference in market size and the stock listing. After all, the size and growth of the American alternative protein market are significant. We, as a company, predict that success in the US market will lead to more than 100 times the growth as of now; thus, we are focusing more than other market developments. Since our stock is in the United States, it also implies that we must not fail in the home country. At the moment, I can’t reveal this in detail due to the information disclosure, but we are talking with the CEO of a particular US fast-food chain for the launch. Sounds exciting. Can you tell us more about the development of the other six countries/regions?
In Europe, we are working on projects in France and Spain, the food capitals, and in China, Hong Kong, India, and Vietnam in Asia. We have secured production lines in China and India, aiming for large-scale and stable supply. We plan to start deployment in both locations by this summer. News about Hong Kong is scheduled to come out this month, which will announce that our products will be available at major Japanese retailers. This year, you became listed on the American OTC Market. What is your intention with this move?
In order to realize our corporate philosophy of “saving the earth,” we need an impact that can save the earth. And for that purpose, ample funds are indispensable. Since financing via banks in Japan is not ideal because of speed and funding limits, listing in the US has been our answer. In the United States, DCF determines corporate value, and speed and scale are at the whole next level. So far, we have mainly asked about the geographical development of your business, but are there any other areas you are currently pouring your resources into?
The current two pillars are an expansion of the production system and research and development. The larger the project, the more urgent it is to secure a stable and mass production facility. As for the second pillar, research and development, what is the purpose of this?
There is an R&D laboratory in my hometown called Nagaoka. We have gathered very talented engineers and food scientists from all over the world, such as Russia, China, and France. Starting from specialists in mechanical design, the team also has professionals in creating and optimizing extruders dedicated to meat substitutes, gene analysis, genome editing, and so on. What are any issues or challenges you currently face as a company?
We need more workforce! The company, which started with two people a year ago, presently has about 50 employees. However, there are still not enough people. The company scale will grow further down the road, and we are looking for passionate people to enhance the impact together with us. Could you tell us something about your future outlook?
As a milestone, we will apply to NASDAQ around this summer and aim to be the fastest in the world from establishment to becoming listed by switching within this year. But what we are looking for is not the title of the fastest in the world. Many people say that the speed of our business development is fast, but we believe it is still slow. I feel that this speed is not enough to save the planet.    "
9405,$1.64 Million Cultured Meat 2021 Market is Expected to Reach $2.7 Billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 95.8% – ResearchAndMarkets.com,https://vegconomist.com/businesswire/1-64-million-cultured-meat-2021-market-is-expected-to-reach-2-7-billion-by-2030-at-a-cagr-of-95-8-researchandmarkets-com/,2021-06-15,"DUBLIN–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The “Cultured Meat Market by Type and End User: Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast 2022-2030” report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com’s offering.  The cultured meat market size was valued at $1.64 million in 2021, and is estimated to reach $2,788.1 million by 2030, registering a CAGR of 95.8% from 2022 to 2030. Cultured meat or in vitro meat offers a safe and disease-free way forward to meet increasing meat requirement without involving animal sacrifices and at the same time, reducing greenhouse emissions, as compared to conventional meat. Growing population, rising affluence and urbanization across the world is likely to increase the demand for meat. Conventional way of meat production is not feasible enough to cop up with rising demand for animal meat. Furthermore, Conventional meat production systems involving ruminant animals, are responsible for the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), contributing about 37% of all the methane emission. Meat consumption also contributes to cardiovascular diseases and animal food-borne diseases. These disadvantages of the farming meat are likely to create the demand and interest for cultured meat. Growing concern about the animal welfare and allergic reaction due to consumption of conventional meat is likely to propel the growth of the cultured meat market during the forecast period. There are enormous benefits associated with the consumption and production of the cultured meat such as zero animal cruelty, Less antibiotic resistance, less deforestation, comparatively low usage of water, land and other resources. However, lack of awareness and high cost of production are considerably expected to hinder the growth of the cultured meat market during the forecast period. Furthermore, availability of the alternative protein further hamper the growth of the global market. The global cultured meat market is segmented into type, end user, and region. By type, it is categorized into red meat, poultry, and seafood. Depending on end user, it is fragmented into household and food services. Region wise, it is analyzed across North America (U.S. and Rest of North America), Europe (UK, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands and Rest of Europe), Asia (Singapore, Japan, China and Rest of Asia), and rest of the world (Israel, UAE and Others).

9417,Two Major Conferences on Alternative Proteins Took Place in Russia This May,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/two-major-conferences-on-alternative-proteins-took-place-in-russia-this-may/,2021-06-11,"And, according to our Russian correspondent Alexey Ivanov from eatingbetter.ru, this is absolutely unheard of. “The Alt Food Conference was the first event of the month, organised by Greenwise and Vatel Marketing in Sochi. It started with the representatives of the Good Food Institute (GFI) and ProVeg Incubator, sharing the state of the European and the US alternative proteins market. Then Greenwise made an overview of the Russian market, which amounted to only around $30 million in 2020. However, the growing interest among major Russian companies suggests that this number will increase every year. Also, Greenwise intends to help small startups grow as part of the newly formed Association of Alternative Food Producers (AAFPP). In 2018/2019, only 17 investments were made in the FoodTech sector in Russia. According to Andrei Zuzin, managing partner of venture fund Fuel for Growth and EFKO group, “It is reasonable to expect an active involvement from the state in the development of FoodTech since more than half of the Russian economy is being controlled by the government” For example, BCG and Blue Horizon report that by the year 2035 the alternative protein market may reach 22%, which would require around $130 billion of investments. In this case, Russia’s share of investment should amount to $2.5 billion – if it wants to keep pace with innovation. It is worth noting that the organisers managed to bring together representatives of start-ups as well as the biggest producers of alternative food in the country. The conference ended with a burger battle, where the winner was burgers made with patties from Greenwise! Just a week later, Deep Food Tech Conference took place in Moscow. This time the event was organised by EFKO group and one of the biggest media for entrepreneurs in Russia – Rusbase. There were Russian FoodTech experts as well as representatives of foreign companies: e.g. Bruce Friedrich from the GFI and Amir Zaidman from The Kitchen Hub, who presented online. There were even two Russian vice-ministers among the speakers! 3D Bioprinting Solutions, which is one of the few Russian companies working on R&D of cultivated meat, displayed their 3D bioprinter to the guests of the conference. It is already possible to try their 3D-printed squid in one of Moscow’s restaurants. The main topics of discussion at the conference were: cultivated meat, fermentation, sweet proteins, personalized nutrition and investments in FoodTech. The programme also touched on the topic of insect farming, whose production is more efficient than many types of meat, however still inferior to the production of plant-based meat. The fact that such events took place says that the interest in alternative proteins in Russia moved far beyond a small niche. And the challenges voiced at both conferences such as lack of regulation of alternatives, funding in FoodTech and governmental support of innovations, showed the direction in which the industry will be working in the coming years.”    "
9422,Report: The Intricacies of Cell Cultured Meat – What’s the Hype all About? The Experts Chime In,https://vegconomist.com/cell-cultured/report-the-intricacies-of-cell-cultured-meat-whats-the-hype-all-about-the-experts-chime-in/,2021-06-10,"On Saturday December 19th, 2020, in a major leap for humankind, something important took place at a Singaporean events establishment called 1880. This was the first time cell cultured meat was approved for consumers and sold to the public, thanks to Eat Just producer of the plant-based brand JUST Egg. “This historic step, the first-ever commercial sale of cultured meat, moves us closer to a world where the majority of meat we eat will not require tearing down a single forest, displacing a single animal’s habitat or using a single drop of antibiotics,” said Josh Tetrick, proud founder of Eat Just. For those unfamiliar with how cell cultured meat is produced, the process involves taking a small sample from an animal. Everything after that takes place in a laboratory. According to Ethica Meat, a brand of the Spanish company Biotech Foods which produces and distributes cell cultured meat, “we extract a sample of tissue by biopsy, without causing any damage and avoiding its [the animal’s] sacrifice. Once the sample is extracted, and due to the innocuity of the process, the animal returns to its daily life. “A fat-free muscle mass is obtained if we so choose, without the need to have sacrificed any animal.” “That sample of meat has in its composition muscle tissue, veins, fat, blood… among other elements. Thanks to the different biomedical techniques that exist today, we can isolate the cells that we want, so in this case, we will choose the proteins that those cells could provide us, isolating the muscle cells for our mission. This process is done in a very short space of time, so those extracted tissues are still alive. “This sample is located in a controlled environment of humidity and temperature, so it continues to form tissue through a natural process of cell proliferation, which means that we are going to put these cells in an aqueous environment that has proteins, amino acids, mineral salts and air, among other elements so that they continue to grow and do their function, which is making muscle tissue full of proteins. “As a result, if they are then placed in a type of fermenter or bioreactor that simulates the animal’s body, a fat-free muscle mass is obtained if we so choose, without the need to have sacrificed any animal. “A type of meat that respects animal welfare, reduces the consumption of natural resources and has no exposure to pandemics, given that the animals we use to extract the samples are in perfect health and throughout the process have no exposure to viruses or bacteria.” Click here to display content from YouTube.

However, for the most stubborn meat lover (a significant portion of the general meat-eating population on Earth) meat substitutes just don’t make the cut, while cultured meat just very well may. “Shifting meat production to these sustainable and humane methods is critical to avoid the huge external costs of industrial animal agriculture,” Bruce Friedrich, GFI. In a recent study carried out by the University of Bath, 44% of French and 58% of Germans said they are willing to try cell cultured meat, while an earlier study by the Good Food Institute showed that 66% of Americans are ready to try clean meat. “Cultivated meat gives consumers everything they love about meat, but produced in a more sustainable and humane way, where animals are removed from the process entirely. This means there is no contribution to pandemic risk or antibiotic resistance, and a fraction of the adverse climate impact,” The Good Food Institute Executive Director Bruce Friedrich told vegconomist. “Shifting meat production to these sustainable and humane methods is critical to avoid the huge external costs of industrial animal agriculture. To stand a chance of meeting the climate targets under the Paris Agreement and mitigating the next pandemic, governments must invest in the open-access research we need to bring cultivated meat to market at scale and make it accessible and affordable for all consumers,” he concluded. “A small biopsy from skin tissue or hair follicle is certainly a place where you can get those cells,” Frea Mehta, Bluu Biosciences. Some ethical vegans may feel uneasy about the fact that this kind of meat still requires animals for the production of food, and others are suspicious that animals may still be harmed in the process. To get some more insights, vegconomist caught up with Frea Mehta, a top scientist for Bluu Biosciences, the first cell cultured seafood company in Europe, to ask her more about the process of extracting cells from living animals. In her own words: “I think it’s a great question actually, where do you actually source these cells from? I think it’s really highly dependent on what you have access to as a company or as a researcher in the space, and what you’re interested in producing because the cells that you get from different parts of the body are going to have different properties that you can leverage in different ways for different applications. “Indeed, the ideal would be the least invasive cell biopsy procedure imaginable. This would be a very small biopsy from something superficial like skin or a follicle of hair. I think these are absolutely sources of cells that exist in the research and industrial space for cell-cultured meat. I think it really is highly dependent and highly variable across the entire space. Theoretically, absolutely a small biopsy from skin tissue or hair follicle is certainly a place where you can get those cells.” Eric Jenkusky, CEO and Cofounder of Matrix Meats, which develops and manufactures nanofiber scaffolds to support the production of clean meat, said in a recent webinar that “even if you take away environmental concerns, and you take away animal rights, if you look at the slaughtered meat industry, strictly from a business sense, and if you were asked to design a new way to deliver meat, would it look like the way our slaughtered meat is today? I would dare say, you would never design the system that we have today, because it’s this multi-century system with compounding issues that were built on top of each other, and you would never ever develop a system like this. “It also is fantastic that we do get to positively affect climate change, and animal rights, et cetera, by doing that. I think this is probably the first time in history where people are actually building systems, taking into account those other factors, where we didn’t in the past. Now, we’re finally doing it, and we have the technology to do it. That’s what’s really, really exciting about this industry.” There is no doubt the food market is shifting in this direction. To drive this point home, 2020 was a record year, not only for cell cultured meat company launches, but also for private investments in this sector. The following are some stats provided by The Good Food Institute. But, as the GFI has stated, “cultured meat will remain just a fraction of the overall market for conventional meat unless governments fund basic R&D as they’ve done for other climate-friendly innovations.” For comparison, renewable energy technology receives over $30 billion worth of global public investments for R&D  every year, while total R&D funding into alternative proteins all-time amounts to about $1 billion, most of which has only been into the private sector. Considering the fact that the conventional meat industry contributes 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions, consumes 55 trillion gallons of water annually (520 times more than fracking at a time when climate change is already making droughts more pervasive) and takes up approximately 45% of the Earth’s habitable land surface, not to mention the relentless cruelty this system has bestowed upon the animal kingdom, it’s time for food companies, consumers, investors and most importantly, governments to embrace this wave of change.

9424,Plant-Based Industry Projected to Increase X 100 and Reach $1.4 TRILLION,https://vegconomist.com/studies-and-numbers/plant-based-industry-projected-to-reach-1-4-trillion/,2021-06-10," Research published in May surveyed a large, representative sample of 2,018 US and 2,034 UK consumers, regarding openness to cell-cultured meat. The results strongly suggest that cell-cultured meat is likely to make up a major part of consumers’ future diets. Although the majority of consumers surveyed were not familiar with the concept of cell cultivated meat, upon being presented with a description, the respondents, on average, imagined that it could likely make up about 40% of their future meat intake, with conventional meat constituting around 60%. Data by the Plant Based Foods Association and The Good Food Institute revealed that the growth rate of US plant-based meat, dairy, and eggs sales has outpaced that of animal products for the third year running, with over 40% of consumers choosing non-dairy milk and one in six US households opting for plant-based meat. Plant-based cheese grew by 42% – almost twice the rate of dairy cheese, while plant-based eggs grew 168%, almost 10 times the rate of poultry eggs. Data revealed that the global vegan food market is predicted to reach $35.5 billion by 2027, while the meat market declined by 3% during 2020. According to Business Expert, this rate of growth indicates that plant-based diets could replace the traditional diet within the next century. Report showed that the global plant-based fish market is projected to surge at an impressive CAGR of around 28% from 2021 to 2031, to top a valuation of US$ 1.3 billion by 2031. Interestingly, the report found that plant-based shrimp is to emerge as the most consumed type. Results showed that, in 2019-20, the revenue from manufacturing plant-based meats was $69.9M, twice what it was in 2018-19. According to the report, if the levels of growth seen over the past year continue then the industry could be worth $3Bn by 2030. Study found that the market for global plant-based meat is projected to grow from USD 3.6 billion in 2020 to USD 4.2 billion by 2021, owing partly to the health benefits perceived by consumers during the pandemic.

9425,"Singapore, Japan, or Canada? Global Pathways for Cell-Cultured Meat Revealed by GFI",https://vegconomist.com/cell-cultured/singapore-japan-or-canada-global-pathways-for-cell-cultured-meat-revealed-by-gfi/,2021-06-10,"Once seen as something resembling science fiction, the cell-cultured meat revolution is now gaining momentum at an unstoppable pace. $366 million was raised by cell-cultured meat companies in 2020 – 6X more than 2019, and some studies have suggested cell-cultured is likely to constitute 40% of future meat consumption. As cell-cultured meat moves ever closer to hitting global markets, many countries are actively establishing regulatory approval pathways. “The rest of the world should be following Singapore’s lead” Giving the regulatory lay of the land for entrepreneurs and emerging cultivated meat startups, the Good Food Institute (GFI) has shared information on several countries and where they currently stand on cell-cultured meat regulation. In this way, nascent cell-cultured companies can better understand the possible regulatory pathways to bring their product to market approval in their area. Speaking about the current regulatory landscape Alex Holst, Policy Manager at the GFI Europe, told vegconomist: “For cultivated meat to fulfill its potential to create a more sustainable, secure and just food system, consumers need to be confident in the food they eat. “Singapore led the way last year with the first-ever regulatory approval of cultivated chicken, following a rigorous process and careful consideration of the best approach. The rest of the world should be following Singapore’s lead by funding sustainable protein research and ensuring a robust and clear path to regulatory approval and oversight.” Singapore
The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has published guidance on its requirements for the safety assessment of novel foods, including specific requirements on the information to be submitted for approval of cultivated meat products. SFA currently assesses applications on a case-by-case basis. SFA is currently in conversation with local cultivated meat and seafood startups, including Shiok Meats, about potential approval of their products, and is very open to working with companies from the early R&D and product development stages. Japan
In theory, cultivated meat (depending on the production method) already falls within the existing regulatory regime in Japan and might not require a premarket assessment or approval. At the same time, the Japanese government is working to develop a specific regulatory framework to properly shape the market while ensuring food safety and consumer acceptance. Industry groups are being formed to create industry standards and liaise with the regulator to create a process to foster consumer confidence. Australia-New Zealand Australia and New Zealand share a joint food regulatory framework and a joint food regulatory agency, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ). Under FSANZ’s “novel food” regulation, cultivated meat and seafood manufacturers must apply to have their products included in the schedule of approved novel foods if they wish to make sales in either country. This requires a safety assessment by FSANZ of the production process, likely lasting at least 14 months. Canada
In Canada, cultivated meat and seafood are characterized as “novel foods” requiring the submission of detailed information in an application for premarket approval. The required information for the novel food submission includes evidence that the food is safe for consumption, including molecular characterization, nutritional composition, toxicology and allergenicity as well as types and levels of chemical contaminants. United States
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees cell collection, cell banks, and all cultivation inputs and processes including cell growth and differentiation, up through the moment of “harvest” from the bioreactors. Meanwhile, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) oversees the further processing and labeling of food products derived from the cells of livestock and poultry. However, the FDA retains jurisdiction over cultivated seafood, excepting catfish, through processing and labeling. European Union
In the EU, the Novel Foods Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 2015/2283) governs pre-market authorizations for foods produced from animal cell or tissue culture. However, if genetic engineering is used in the production of cultivated meat, the Regulation on genetically modified food and feed (Regulation (EC) 1829/2003) might apply instead. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) usually conducts a risk assessment and gives a scientific opinion on the safety and nutritional aspects of the product. If that opinion is positive, final approval rests with the European Commission and representatives from all EU member states. United Kingdom
With its exit from the EU, the UK is no longer participating in the EU’s common food authorization procedures. As of May 2021, any cultivated meat companies wanting to sell their products in the UK need to apply for authorization to the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA). The UK retained relevant EU law and the substance of the risk assessment of both novel foods and genetically modified food authorizations remains the same as in the EU. The most substantial difference between the UK and EU regulatory approval concerns the final approval decision. In the UK, it will be government ministers taking the decision as opposed to the EU, where final approval is governed by the, likely more elaborate and possibly more time consuming, committee procedure involving the European Commission and representatives from all 27 EU member states.

9436,"Real Milk, No Cows: Israeli Startup Imagindairy Introduces Fast-to-Market Functional Animal-Free Dairy Proteins",https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/real-milk-no-cows-israeli-startup-imagindairy-introduces-fast-to-market-functional-animal-free-dairy-proteins/,2021-06-09,"Though the rise and rise of plant-based milks has been outstanding, many consumers of cow’s milk products may feel plant-based dairy alternatives fall short of meeting their sensory demands. Israeli start-up Imagindairy Ltd. is creating true dairy proteins via a natural process of precision fermentation, yet still leaving the cow out of the equation.  The unique protein structure of dairy milk is what provides its characteristic texture, flavor, and nutritional value. Imagindairy’s animal-free dairy products boast the same complement of nutrients as cow’s milk, from protein content to mineral composition, including calcium. At the same time, the proprietary technology radically lowers the burden of dairy livestock on the environment. While the plant-based and cell-cultured sectors continue to expand – both in dairy alternatives and beyond – the fermentation sector has emerged as the third pillar of alternative proteins at a staggering rate. $587 million was invested in fermentation companies in 2020 alone, representing more than half of the all-time investment in the segment. According to a recent GFI report, 51 fermentation companies focused exclusively or predominantly on alternative proteins are currently in operation, developing fungi, yeast, algae, or dairy proteins.  Imagindairy’s proprietary technology recreates nature-identical, animal-free versions of whey and casein proteins that can be used to produce dairy analogs. With the same flavor, texture, and functionality of their animal-based counterparts, it opens new opportunities to develop a full range of non-dairy products that perfectly mimic dairy versions yet contain no cholesterol, or GMO’s. They also are lactose-free, serving consumers with lactose intolerance or sensitivity.  “Our microflora-based production method was inspired by nature to recreate these proteins,” explains Eyal Afergan, PhD, Co-founder and CEO of Imagindairy.  Imagindairy’s technology can be readily integrated into existing dairy food production facilities. The Israeli start-up has already raised US$1.5M in seed funding and will soon enter its A-round funding series. Israel boasts significant investment in the alt protein sphere, with a new study revealing the total investment in companies developing alt proteins in Israel has increased X8 across the plant-based, cell-cultured, and fermentation fields. “Our vision was to deliver an animal-free version of the primary dairy proteins — whey and casein — that can allow product makers to match real dairy products in terms of protein concentration, nutrient profile, and the full sensory experiences of the animal-derived versions,” continued Afergan. “I look forward to being able to give my kids such treats as a cup of nutritious, tasty milk or creamy yogurt without the hard impact on animals or on the environment they must inherit.”    "

So, of course, if it is going to cost hundreds of dollars, no one will do it.  So, when is cultivated/cellular meat going to get close to the actual price of meat? Patricia Bubner: The goal is to bring the price down, but also, you know, it’s my favorite pet peeve. What is the true price of meat today? You know, if we look at the price at which people expect to buy meat, that’s ridiculous. That’s not what it costs to produce. The farmers don’t get a fair share and the animals, as you say, are suffering, right? So, I think there needs to be a holistic discussion about how our food system should look and what part alternative proteins and plant-based solutions can take in there, and how we can make all of these cost-efficient. Impossible Foods and also Beyond have done a great job with starting at a higher margin and then slashing the prices down. So, I think that’s something that we will see in cell-cultured meat, as well. Benjamina Bollag: Yeah, and I think you also have to look at is it the price of cultivated meat as a stand-alone or is it a price of a hybrid because you have various degrees and various amounts. Depending on the product, it will be more or less important. So if you’re doing certain meats, it will be very important to have a high percentage of cultivated meat versus if you’re doing a sausage or nugget, you don’t necessarily need that. And the proof is most of the plant-based alternatives are already pretty good. Elysabeth: Well, let’s talk about that. Do you see a blending of plant-based and cultivated? So, a plant-based meat alternative, let’s say like a nugget with a cultivated fat. Benjamina Bollag: There’s no question whether the first products will be this way. I think the question is which products will endure in the long term. So whether in the long term will it stay a hybrid, will it always be a hybrid, or at some point will you be looking at an eighty percent cultivated meat product? Elysabeth: Interesting, then let me ask your perspective. I’ll go with Nieves and then Stephanie. Do you foresee that plant-based foods become obsolete? Nieves Martinez: No, I don’t think so and mainly for the fact that, as we said in the beginning, cell-based meat is geared towards meat lovers, right? And plant-based is more for vegans and vegetarians because they don’t enjoy meat and they really love these plant-based alternative protein products. So I don’t see it as one or the other. Elysabeth: But as we look to the market, Stephanie, how do you think it’s going to shake out? These are just guesses at this point, but how do you think it’s going to shake out and who’s going to have the lion’s share of the market? Is it cultivated or plant-based meat? Stephanie Michelsen: Ooh, that’s a very tough question. I think it depends on a lot of things. We’re so early on, like Patricia said, we’re at the beginning of this. So, I think it will also be a question of the consumer and what their preferences are and, of course, just technology and how quickly we can do it. I think with cell-based it’s no longer a question of if, it’s how fast and how soon, right? As for what will happen, that’s hard to say and when it comes to plant-based, I also think that if you think about things like tempeh and falafel, these are things that we don’t consider meat analogs, but they are still kind of like a protein source. I think there can be opportunities for new products that we don’t even think about, like we don’t have to have veggies always imitate meat, right? They can stand on their own and that’s why I think they will always be there. Like Nieves said, they are delicious in their own way. And then hybrids are super exciting, too, to get these unique flavors, textures, and fats and things like that and just come up with new things, right? Because that’s what we can do now. We have this technology. Elysabeth: I love that you say that because, of course, food is nostalgic for all of us and it brings up memories and feelings, but innovation is what we do. So when people say to me, “Oh, you know, we’ve never done that before” or “we shouldn’t do that. That’s something too new” I just think, are you going to put us in the back of the bus? Come on, the world is changing. That’s like saying, “Oh no, don’t use a computer, I really have to have a typewriter.” Who would do that? Now you can be a part of the conversation.

9497,Sophie’s Bionutrients: “Unlocking Macro Nutrients at Micro Level is the ONLY Way Forward to a Sustainable Future that Creates Minimal Footprint”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/sophies-bionutrients-unlocking-macro-nutrients-at-micro-level-is-the-only-way-forward-to-a-sustainable-future-that-creates-minimal-footprint/,2021-05-28,"Alt meat comes in many forms, with plant-based manufacturers using protein-rich ingredients such as soy and peas. Singaporean startup Sophie’s Bionutrients however is taking a different path by harnessing the myriad powers of microalgae, and recently developed the world’s first milk made from algae, comparable in nutritional value to cow’s milk and with all the essential amino acids as microalgae. “A radical change in the way we think about protein production is ever more important.” Following this week’s news of the world’s first commercialization of microalgae meat (see image below) using Sophie’s Bionutrients microalgae protein, now available in a rice dumpling product in Taiwan, we were pleased to speak with co-founder Eugene Wang, to find out more about this superfood of the future. What’s your elevator pitch, Eugene?
To accommodate the exploding population and meet the growing demands of protein, a radical change in the way we think about protein production is ever more important.  The current status quo does not offer a cure, doing less harm is no longer enough.  Unlocking macro-nutrients at the micro-level is the ONLY way forward to a sustainable future that creates minimal footprint.  Our technologies will allow us to decouple protein supply from arable land while reducing the environmental footprint will be an essential part of the solutions. “Our microalgae have ALL the essential amino acids needed by human beings” What is the story behind the name Sophie’s Bionutrients?
I was born and grew up in Taiwan.  I come from a family where we are four-generation Buddhists and have been making vegetarian food for three-generation already.  So, when I found out my daughter Sophie is allergic to shellfish, I started to find ways for people to get the nutrients from the ocean without using the animals.  I initially used our family’s technologies to make plant-based seafood. I was probably the first one in the world to start a plant-based seafood company. Sophie’s Kitchen was launched in Sebastopol California back in 2010.  And, during the last ten years, my customers kept asking me if my products have equivalent nutritional value to real seafood.  The short answer is NO, we were using potato starch and pea protein. That got me thinking. People think seafood is healthy (or is it?) – therefore, in order for them to give up seafood, we have to come up with something better. Then I thought, fishes and shrimp get their nutrients from microalgae. From this idea, I started my microalgae research back in 2013 in California, and in 2017 I was invited by the Singapore government to come here to pitch.  I immediately won my first big grant (SWITCH SLINGSHOT 2017) that year.  Ever since then, this research project has moved to Singapore. In 2019, we won another grand prize at The Liveability Challenge with Temasek Foundation.  That was the moment we realized the two units (Singapore B2B Food Tech and California B2C Consumer Brand) need to be separated. I like tech. So, I decided to stay in Singapore and head this unit.  We then renamed ourselves Sophie’s BioNutrients back in 2019. What are the benefits of using microalgae to produce food and drink?
Nutritionally, our microalgae have ALL the essential amino acids needed by human beings.  It even has a complete vitamin B family.  Both of these are not seen with any plant-based protein.  And its nutrition is even more than most of the animal protein we are eating today. “We will be one of the very few teams who can actually deliver a “practical” alternative protein to the food industry” What other functions can microalgae serve?
Microalgae also has a lot of lipids.  You can use the lipid to make 1. cooking oil (to sustainably replace palm) 2. Biofuel 3. Biodegradable plastic replacements. What makes Sophie’s Bionutrients different to other companies in this emerging sector?
I come from a food manufacturing background.  And, unlike a lot of other startups which jump into the plant-based landscape because it is hot, I have been in this industry for my whole career. I know what food manufacturers want from protein.  Whereas a lot of other microalgae companies are started and led by biologists. We will be one of the very few teams who can actually deliver a “practical” alternative protein to the food industry while most of the teams are still only able to deliver premium nutraceutical ingredients. What plans do you have to scale up in the future?
We are raising money right now to set up our company own facility in Singapore.  We are also planning to use a few contract manufacturers around the world to quickly expand our production capacity and serve local markets.  Our protein flour is already being used in some food products and can be seen in some retail stores in Asia.  Within three years, you should see the retail stores near you selling some of the products which have our protein flour in them.    "

Such a lack of regulatory framework could prove a major stumbling block as alt protein looks to challenge conventional meat production and offer better solutions to the issues of climate change, food supplies, and zoonotic disease outbreaks. To that end, the World Health Organization’s Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WHO WPRO) has united with The Good Food Institute (GFI) as part of a two-day workshop with the focus on: “Regulatory and Food Safety Aspects of Alternative Proteins for Conventional Animal Products.”  “The way we produce, process, commercialize, prepare, and consume foods has become unsustainable” The WHO WPRO and GFI share the belief that strong regulations would be vital in advancing the alt protein sector, which could well be the key to improving food security, preventing the destruction of the environment, as well as dealing with global poverty. Food safety considerations of cell-cultured meat production, scientific overviews of plant-based proteins and microbial fermentation, insights into consumer perception of alternative proteins, and a case study of Singapore’s forward-thinking regulatory processes were among the topics covered. “The food we will eat in the future is already here” The GFI recently released its authoritative State of the Industry annual reports covering the plant-based, cellular agriculture, and fermentation sectors, with the urgent need for increased public sector involvement highlighted. The sentiment was echoed in an article by US commentator Ezra Klein in his New York Times column. “The way we produce, process, commercialize, prepare, and consume foods has become unsustainable […] The possibility of producing alternative meat without slaughtering animals carries an obvious benefit. As does the availability of a meat product with a much-reduced environmental impact and reduced health concerns linked with emergence of novel diseases at the animal-human-environment interface. “The food we will eat in the future is already here. […] Adapting your regulatory frameworks to include new foods is essential to protect consumer sales and make alternative and nutritious food available,” declared Dr. Babatunde Olowokure, Director of WHO WPRO’s Division of Health Security and Emergencies, during the formal proceedings of the meeting.

9512,What US Consumers Want in Alternative Seafood Products,https://vegconomist.com/studies-and-numbers/what-us-consumers-want-in-alternative-seafood-products/,2021-05-26,"A new survey conducted by GFI and Kelton Global showed that, in addition to excellent taste and texture, messaging about alternative seafood products’ environmental, health, and functional benefits can broaden their appeal among US consumers. Article written by Marika Azoff and reproduced with kind permission from the GFI, Read the full report here. There is an urgent and sizable need for new approaches to meet increasing global demand for seafood, and alternative seafood is well poised to meet that demand. However, as the alternative protein industry continues to grow, with plant-based retail sales reaching $7 billion in 2020, alternative seafood remains a significant white space. To date, little research has been conducted on consumer attitudes towards alternative seafood. To fill this gap, GFI partnered with consumer insights and brand strategy firm, Kelton Global, to determine U.S. consumer needs, preferences, and motivations as they relate to choosing alternative seafood. This study surveyed 2,500 U.S. residents ages 18 to 65, with the sample reflecting nationwide population demographics. The results illustrate which consumers are interested in alternative seafood and why, offering key insights for industry players to better appeal to potential consumers and propel the entire industry forward. Participants in this study were grouped into three categories—alternative seafood enthusiasts, alternative seafood interested, and alternative seafood rejectors—based on how appealing they found plant-based or cultivated seafood and how likely they were to purchase either. Notably, a greater proportion of alternative seafood enthusiasts are flexitarian and pescatarian than the general consumer. Alternative seafood is therefore already appealing to groups beyond vegans and vegetarians. Consumers repeatedly cited taste and texture as the most important factors in determining whether or not they would eat alternative seafood products. When asked which functional factors were most important in choosing alternative seafood over conventional seafood, the majority of consumers cited flavor as most important, followed by food safety, tasting like conventional seafood, and texture. When asked why they might not choose alternative seafood, most consumers also cited anticipated taste and texture as barriers to choosing alternative seafood. Proper messaging about alternative seafood benefits is crucial to consumer trial and adoption. 78 percent of consumers would try plant-based and cultivated seafood based on flavor messaging alone. Once consumers have a positive impression of alternative seafood flavor, messaging focused on these products’ environmental, health, and functional benefits are likely to bring additional consumers into the category. For cultivated seafood, messaging about these products’ ocean habitat benefits, protein content, lack of “fishy” smell, and reduction in plastic waste produced by ocean fishing can generate additional gains in reach. And for plant-based seafood, messaging about reduction in overfishing and plastic waste from fishing, high omega-3 content, and lack of fish bones can generate additional gains in reach. Consumers consistently ranked plant-based and cultivated seafood motivations and barriers in the same order of importance. This was true for environmental and health and functionality benefits—with only a few negligible differences in the functionality category. After learning about plant-based and cultivated seafood, 42 percent of consumers found plant-based seafood appealing and 43 percent would consider purchasing it in the future. 35 percent of respondents found cultivated seafood appealing and 38 percent would consider purchasing it in the future. As incomes rise and population increases, the United Nations projects an increase in demand for seafood of more than 45 million tons between the mid-2010s and early-2020s. In the short term, we could see as much as a 30 percent increase in global demand in the coming decade. This consumer research shows that both plant-based and cultivated seafood are well poised to appeal to the general consumer in the United States, and play a huge role in meeting the growing demand for seafood in a more sustainable way. To successfully meet this global demand with alternative seafood, we need to develop a more complete picture of global seafood consumers’ needs, preferences and motivations. Additional consumer research in other geographic regions such as Asia and Europe, where seafood consumption is highest globally, would provide critical insights needed to broaden the alternative seafood industry’s reach and adoption. Sensory research and evaluations are also needed to better understand how the seafood products currently on the market are meeting consumer’s sensory expectations and where key product development opportunities lie. Open-access research can help us answer these key questions and ultimately propel the alternative seafood industry forward. In support of a better food future, GFI’s Sustainable Seafood Initiative will continue to support open-access research to maximize the likelihood of success for alternative seafood over time.      "

With lambs currently slaughtered at an incredibly young age using traditional farming methods, its founder tells us this particular meat became the obvious choice for the company’s first product range. “There is absolutely no need for the mass slaughter of animals for food and hopefully intensive animal agriculture will soon be a thing of the past” Vegconomist spoke with Founder Paul Bevan, who says that he had become frustrated by the pace of change and effectiveness of his own activism so he turned his attention to technology, specifically the development of slaughter-free cultured meat, beginning with lamb. Utilising induced pluripotent stem-cells and FBS-free media, Magic Valley is able to grow real animal meat from animal cells, using animals such as Lucy, who Paul refers to as “cell volunteers”. “Eventually we would like to expand into developing cultured meat products for all other animal species” “Lucy the lamb is our very special cell donor. From just a tiny skin biopsy less than 4mm in diameter we are able to generate an infinite number of muscle and fat cells without ever having to interfere with an animal again. That is one of the distinct advantages of our technology and using induced pluripotent stem cells. Meanwhile, Lucy gets to live out the entirety of her natural life (up to 20 years of age) happy and unharmed, blissfully unaware that her cell donation has potentially saved the lives of billions of lambs that would otherwise have been slaughtered at just 6 months of age.” Magic Valley’s team consisting of Australia’s leading scientists have extensive experience in both stem cell biology and livestock production. As part of its ambitions to become a leader in the field, the company also announced this week the onboarding of industry pioneer Dr. Sandhya Sriram, PhD, Co-Founder & CEO of the cell-based crustacean producers Shiok Meats, to its advisory board. “Eventually we would like to expand into developing cultured meat products for all other animal species that have traditionally been farmed for human consumption. With the advancement of this technology, there is absolutely no need for the mass slaughter of animals for food and hopefully intensive animal agriculture will soon be a thing of the past,” Bevan commented to vegconomist. “Our immediate goal is to develop the safest, healthiest and tastiest cultured lamb products possible. We know that to be successful, cultured meat products have to become the obvious choice for consumers and that means taste, price & convenience are paramount. We know that ethical or environmental concerns alone are not enough to change consumer behaviour – it has to be a better product.”    "

Based in Paris, the mission-driven startup is an inclusive workplace addressing the French market’s need for plant-based options and alternative proteins at price parity. “It’s simple: we want to be everywhere that mainstream fast food is.” Furahaa Group is a three-pronged entity that has both B2B and B2C segment, founded in 2015 by young entrepreneur Arthur Devillers, which has three operating subsidiaries: PlantB2B, ViVeg, and its eponymous dining venue, Furahaa. Plant B2B is a supply chain and distribution entity that also stocks the Group’s restaurants, while ViVeg is one of the company’s B2C arms with a vegan food subscription box business model, and Furahaa is the company’s highly-rated vegan fast-food chain. “Furahaa would like to be the first plant-based chain in France” Devillers noted that the fast-food segment of his group will see new menu items in the near future, with the aim of adopting the latest food science developments in the vegan ecosystem. “Furahaa Group was initially seeking like-minded investors to ensure our stock stability. We wanted to better meet shortages of plant-based foodstuffs, as in France alternative proteins – meat and dairy alternatives – are not yet widely available at competitive price points,” said Devillers. “Sourcing quality ingredients at price parity was a challenge, so this led to Furahaa Group developing our own supply chain and distribution streams.” Prince Khaled commented on the investment: “This is my first investment in the French market. Furahaa Group, driven by Arthur’s vision for an inclusive and diverse workplace, while giving both consumers and other vendors a route to choose plant-based options, had me interested in the business immediately. “The distribution business is strong, and during the pandemic I saw a swift and organized pivot– something any investor would find very attractive in a portfolio company,” he continued. The Group has plans to expand in France with the opening of new Furahaa outlets, and has plans to launch a franchise model: “Furahaa would like to be the first plant-based chain in France. It’s simple: we want to be everywhere that mainstream fast food is, but offering plant-based, delicious, ethical alternatives.” Furahaa Group joins existing KBW Ventures portfolio companies from the plant-based realm: Rebellyous Foods, makers of plant-based chicken with B2B and B2C verticals, American fast-food mainstay Veggie Grill, and vegan jerky company Moku Foods.

This investment marks Orkla’s first investment in pet food and the first move for its Orkla Alternative Proteins (OAP) unit, which was recently established with the intention of becoming one of the leading competitors in the field of alternative proteins in Europe by 2030. “Partnering with a major international food player like Orkla is exactly what we sought to do from the beginning,” Shannon Falconer. The closing of the heavily oversubscribed round brings the startup’s total financing to $6.7 million to date, with follow-on investment from SOSV, Draper Associates, Keen Growth Capital, and others. With the fresh funds, Because, Animals will scale up production, and accelerate development of its first commercial cultured meat pet product, a cat treat. In the near term, the company is also developing a nutritionally complete, plant and culture-based dog food to add to its current line of treats.    Because, Animals was co-founded in 2016 by Shannon Falconer, PhD, and Joshua Errett, MBA. The company closed its first seed round in 2019 and announced success in creating the world’s first cultured meat pet food made from cultured mouse tissue, the ancestral diet of the cat. Amongst the company’s success, n 2020 it was awarded the Purina Pet Care Innovation Prize, and it has also developed a proprietary alternative to fetal bovine serum, an animal-based ingredient still heavily relied upon by other producers of cell-based meats.   “As a company deeply committed to health and sustainability, we see cultured meat as having interesting potential in terms of sustainability, animal welfare, and food safety. Because, Animals’ products and technology are truly differentiated, and stand out as a sustainable, healthy, humane way to feed pets. Their progress in developing cell lines, growth media, and driving down cost is impressive – all vital steps in bringing cultured meat technology to market,” said Elin Tveito Lidman, the recently appointed CEO of Orkla Alternative Proteins.   “Partnering with a major international food player like Orkla is exactly what we sought to do from the beginning,” said Because, Animals CEO Shannon Falconer, PhD. “We were not interested in just any corporate food heavyweight, we needed them to be firm believers in sustainability and the future of food, and we’ve found exactly that combination in Orkla.”     "

The innovative products with a cult following have been available through e-commerce since the end of March, and today marks the first time these long-awaited products have been available in stores, through a distribution agreement with Whole Foods.  Last summer saw the company, founded by former economic advisor to the Australian government and food industry expert Veronica Fil along with husband, the renowned fine-dining chef Shaun Quade, close an oversubscribed seed round led by Stray Dog Capital. Since then, the founders have developed an extensive variety of cheese styles, including soft, hard, aged and rind cheeses as well as sauces, created in a manner completely unique to Grounded. Many plant-based cheeses, especially those in the lower price brackets, are produced with made from nuts or coconut oil, which involve implications to both health and sustainability. However, Grounded is leveraging hemp and imperfect produce (the leaves, stems and ‘ugly’ cauliflower that can’t be sold in grocery stores), to create a more sustainable and environmentally resilient alternative. The result is a range of 100% plant-based cheeses that are top allergen-free and dense in nutritional value—including calcium, protein, antioxidants, Omega 3 + 6 fats, vitamins and minerals. “More and more consumers are incorporating alternative proteins into their diets for health and environmental reasons,” said CEO Veronica Fil. “Our goal is to introduce better tasting, more sustainable and more nutritious products to the plant-based cheese category—and appeal to those consumers who are not necessarily vegan, but are interested in cutting back on dairy.” The products available this month are Grounded’s first three offerings as follows. Grounded products are currently available online via their website and at Pop Up Grocer in Chicago. From this month, consumers can purchase these products in-store at select Whole Foods Market locations and retailers throughout California, Illinois, New York, Hawaii, Connecticut, Arizona and Oregon.

The Global Cultured Meat Market is expected to be valued at USD 206.6 Million in the year 2025. The reasons expected to facilitate growth of the market are rapid urbanisation, changing dietary preferences of people and growing concerns for animal welfare. Further, the growing awareness about the lab grown meat and other health related benefits are going to lead the market in the forecast period. Also, the growing demand of meat and increasing slaughter of animals is forcing to move towards the consumption of cultured meat. Moreover, the surging demand for growing trend of veganism and growing concerns for environment sustainability are anticipated to act as an advantage for the market to grow over the forecast period. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected the meat industry in an unexpected way, due to which imports and exports from so many countries have been stopped which is giving a rise to the lab grown meat so that industry can be ready for such kind of crisis in future as well. Further, the demand for nuggets is comparatively higher as compared to other segments of this category globally. People have different preferences, tastes and priority when it comes to food which is an important factor to drive the market growth of a particular region or a country. The Asia Pacific regional market is expected to witness significant growth over the forecast period, majorly due to the increasing demand of meat and rapid urbanisation along with high disposable income. Rising technological advancements and investment in new startups involved in this industry are expected to boost the market growth in the forecast period. Furthermore, the growing adoption of veganism and healthy lifestyle is directly influencing the growth. This trend is observed in numerous parts of the North American and Asia Pacific regions. Elsewhere in Europe, the UK’s ‘Higher Steaks’ is growing stem cells for the production of mince for pork sausages. Instead of using fetal bovine serum, the company uses protocols exclusively licensed to it by its collaborators, the University of Minnesota, that allow it to reprogram stem cells into muscle and fat tissues.

With this transaction, GOOD Meat, the world’s first cell-cultured meat to be available to consumers, becomes a subsidiary of Eat Just, which announced a $200 million fundraise this March. “This investment points to what’s ahead: meat without killing animals will replace conventional meat at some point in our lifetimes,” Josh Tetrick Eat Just, recently named as a “World-Changing Company of the Year” by Fast Company, reports that GOOD Meat has been recently focused on staff recruitment, technology and manufacturing infrastructure to meet the surging demand and to prepare for market entry in the USA. The company states it will quickly scale production in North America and Asia through multi-million-dollar investments in facilities in the US and Singapore. Since securing the first-in-the-world regulatory approval, GOOD Meat has become available to home consumers through a partnership with foodpanda, Asia’s leading food and grocery delivery platform. The company also announces the JW Marriott Singapore South Beach’s famous restaurant Madame Fan will become the first in the world to replace conventional meat with cultured meat during set times. The new chef-inspired dishes include Asian-inspired chicken salad with sesame mirin vinaigrette, steamed chicken dumplings and chicken vegetable stir-fry. GOOD Meat will replace conventional chicken for delivery on Thursdays from this Thursday, 20th May, and for once-a-week dine-in starting soon. “This investment, along with the historic decision by JW Marriott Singapore South Beach, points to what’s ahead: meat without killing animals will replace conventional meat at some point in our lifetimes. The faster we make that happen, the healthier our planet will be,” said Josh Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of Eat Just. The latest investment came from funds managed by UBS O’Connor, a hedge fund manager within UBS Asset Management, Graphene Ventures, K3 Ventures and others.    "

Co-founder Russ Tucker, originally from a family of butchers, says the startup plans to produce cultured sausages for supermarkets and restaurants by 2023, followed by meatballs and beefburgers, with plans to produce up to 12,000 tonnes of cultured pork per year by 2025, the equivalent of saving 170,000 pigs from slaughter.  Ivy Farm’s non-GMO production process uses technology developed at Oxford University, in the same building that developed the Covid-19 vaccine. “Already nearly half the worldwide harvest is required to feed livestock and that’s only going to go up. Cultured meat is the silver bullet – through cutting edge technology we can provide real, high-quality meat while saving the planet. Ivy Farm will be great for the environment, great for meat lovers†† and great for animals as there’s no slaughter.”  In a press release sent to vegconomist, Ivy Farms says it “has ambitions to put Britain on the map in the emerging global industry by producing products made from meat that has been made without GM additives, antibiotics or the need to slaughter animals (beginning with a guilt-free sausage) for supermarkets and the restaurant trade from 2023.” Ivy Farm has launched a fundraising campaign with a target of £16 million to build a pilot research and development facility, as the first step on the road to commercial production of cultured pork in the UK. Ivy Farm aims to address the serious environmental impacts of the conventional livestock industry. Dr Tucker believes that cultured meat is not only better for the planet, but it’s better for consumers as their process doesn’t use GM techniques or antibiotics. Ivy Farm is confident it will co-exist with progressive, traditional farming methods, offering an opportunity to re-shape the traditional UK farming system, and ensure it is ready to deal with 21st century pressures. The startup carried out research which found two thirds of people said they’d be happy to try cultured meat – and more than half said they’d be willing to buy it, demonstrating a huge potential market in the UK. “Already nearly half the worldwide harvest is required to feed livestock and that’s only going to go up.

The following is for the week ending May 14, 2021. Plant-based for under five dollars! Target rolls out thirty new products including plant-based chocolate milk, cauliflower wings, nuggets, meatballs, and more. The eighth-largest retailer in the U.S. has this to say: “We want to give people what they want.” Target is in the game! My business bottom line is – welcome to the party! Journal News reports that eighty-eight percent of Gen Z and eighty-four percent of Millennials say that they’re willing to try cultivated meat. The group on average, which also did include Gen X and Boomers, said that they anticipate in the future that forty percent of their meat intake would come from cellular meat. My business bottom line here is that whenever cellular meat gets to the grocery store, assuming it has price parity and, of course, great taste, it will be adopted at an exponential rate because no one would ever choose to have hormones, antibiotics, environmental damage and crushing animal welfare if they didn’t have to make that choice, and soon they will not have to make that choice.

Always display content from YouTube My favorite news this week in addition to an IPO from Oatly, which is around the corner even as early as this week, comes from GFI. GFI states that Appropriations Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro calls for parity in research funding in alternative proteins. She said this to the U.S. secretary of agriculture.  In all honesty, the U.S. has been slow to fund this kind of research. It’s disappointing. My business bottom line is that food security is actually an issue of national security as food and water become scarce due to population growth and climate change. If we don’t invest in our own food supply through research into alternative proteins, you will see a rise in political tensions around the world and that’s bad for business. My LinkedIn question for the week is – would you try cellular meat? Lou Cooperhouse of Blue Nalu has given me an invitation to go down to San Diego to try Blue Nalu’s fish as soon as it is ready. I have not forgotten this Lou, so I will be the first in line as soon as I can. You let me know on LinkedIn what you would do. This has been the Plantbased Business minute.

Researchers at Sejong University in Seoul unveiled the cell-cultured pork meat prototype after working on the project since 2018.  The Sejong University team, led by Professor Park Sungkwon of the university’s food science and biotechnology department, developed the cell-cultured meat by culturing muscle stem cells extracted from pig skeletal muscle to produce muscle tissue similar to conventional meat. Supported by the South Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, the research has been carried out in partnership with Seoul National University and Space F, a cellular agriculture startup specializing in future-friendly food solutions. Along with the pork prototype, the team has also reported the completion of a cell-cultured beef which will be released in the coming months. With a 43% increase of new cell-cultured meat companies launching in 2020, and upwards of $366 million raised by cell-cultured meat companies in the same year – a sixfold increase on 2019 – the cellular agriculture sector is taking off at a huge rate. In fact, a recent study strongly suggests that cell-cultured meat is likely to make up 40% of consumers’ future diets, and the Sejong University research team’s next step is to look at the commercialization of its developments. “We can open up the possibility of securing the fundamental technology for cultured meat production,” Professor Park said in a statement. “We are aiming to advance this technology for commercialization through further research and optimization.”    "

This signifies that the company is now ready for business with its first consumer product: chicken. To create its cultured meat at scale, UPSIDE Foods has broken ground on a pilot plant in the San Francisco Bay Area. The product will be available to consumers this year, pending regulatory approval. Last January, Memphis Meats announced it had received investment totalling in excess of $180 million, including a Series B round of $161 million, with participants such as Bill Gates and Richard Branson. The company is also backed by Prince Khaled’s KBW Ventures. As the first custom-built for meat cultivation, the company announces that its new end-to-end facility will produce, package and ship cultured meat at a larger scale than any other company in the industry, all under one roof. UPSIDE Foods states that its pilot plant will be an international model for creating real, delicious, resource-efficient meat. “We want to become the preferred brand for the next generation of meat lovers” “Our team introduced the world to cultured meat, and the evolution to UPSIDE Foods communicates our passion and potential to make our favorite foods healthier for the planet,” said Uma Valeti, CEO and founder of UPSIDE Foods. “Our new name showcases the work we are doing to make eating meat a force for good.

Ultimately, MeaTech plans to  produce real meat cuts, such as steak or chicken breast, using 3D bioprinting technology. The cultured fat production process will be designed to deploy technologies developed by recently acquired Belgian subsidiary Peace of Meat, whose laboratory work and public taste tests have shown that cultured chicken fat has the potential to significantly enhance the flavor, mouthfeel, and texture of plant-based alternative meat products whilst reducing the total number of ingredients. Sharon Fima, CEO of MeaTech, states: “We believe that our cultured fat is an extremely promising additive ingredient that can potentially improve the taste, texture, and mouthfeel of plant-based alternative meats, which we believe can further drive market growth. “A key challenge facing the cultured meat industry is cost-efficient production. We believe that establishing this pilot plant facility and scaling up our cellular agriculture technologies will be a significant step forward toward achieving cost parity with conventional meat as well as realizing MeaTech’s vision for the ‘Factory of the Future’ – comprising the inputs, processes and equipment underlying a flexible cultured meat manufacturing facility.” Dirk von Heinrichshorst, CEO and Co-Founder of Peace of Meat: “Setting up a pilot plant to produce Peace of Meat’s cultured chicken fat at scale will be a significant milestone. With it, we believe we can demonstrate a fully functional production process to B2B customers looking to include cultured ingredients in their products. We believe the pilot plant can be a model for larger scale future production facilities.”    "
9605,Cell Cultured Meat is Likely to Constitute 40% of Future Meat Consumption,https://vegconomist.com/studies-and-numbers/cell-cultured-meat-is-likely-to-constitute-40-of-future-meat-consumption/,2021-05-12,"A new piece of research published today May 11 by the journal Foods and led by Keri Szejda, PhD, surveyed a large, representative sample of 2,018 US and 2,034 UK consumers, regarding openness to cell-cultured meat. The results strongly suggest that cell-cultured meat is likely to make up a major part of consumers’ future diets.  Although the majority of consumers surveyed were not familiar with the concept of cell cultivated meat, upon being presented with a description, the respondents, on average, imagined that it could likely make up about 40% of their future meat intake, with conventional meat constituting around 60%. In terms of age group, the study found that 87-89% of Gen Z adults, 84-85% of Millennials, 76-77% of Gen X, and 70-74% of Boomers were at least somewhat open to trying cultivated meat. In the US and the UK, 40% of consumers were “very” or “extremely likely” to try cell-cultured meat, with this group being categorized as the “early majority” group. Of this group, an overwhelming 98-99% of them said they would consider welcoming it as a regular item in their shopping basket. The vast majority of the early majority are omnivores (94-95%) who consume meat 2-3 times per day in a typical week. “In order to turn this expected acceptance into actual consumption patterns over time, it is critical to develop the right products, based on the right solutions,” says Didier Toubia, Co-Founder and CEO of Aleph Farms, which commissioned the research. “In the long term, Aleph Farms’ vision is to provide a better alternative to industrial livestock farming, which represents approximately 70% of global meat production today.” “The results suggest that cultivated meat is likely to be widely accepted by the general public, especially the younger generations and an eager group of early adopters who appreciate its benefits across a wide range of social issues. These groups tend to embrace change and need little encouragement to try new food innovations,” notes Szejda, PhD, Founder and Principal Research Scientist of North Mountain Consulting Group. “Additionally, we observed an increase in support for the technology once consumers had access to additional information, underscoring the importance of effective science communication for consumer adoption.” Sociodemographic analyses comparing the early majority groups to the general population suggest that the early majority are more often younger (Gen Z or Millennials), male, more liberal, and more educated. In the US and the UK, an average of 77% of Gen X and 74% of Boomers were open to trying it, in comparison to 85% of Millennials, and 89% of Gen Z. “In contrast to the younger eager adopters, the older generations are more wary of change,” explains Toubia. “Social proof is important to them and they want to be assured that a product is safe, functional, and beneficial before they adopt it. This is why transparency and trust are cornerstones of our company,” concludes Toubia.

9609,GFI’s State of the Industry Report Reveals We Are “Closer to Realizing a World Where Alternative Proteins Are No Longer Alternative”,https://vegconomist.com/studies-and-numbers/gfis-state-of-the-industry-report-reveals-we-are-closer-to-realizing-a-world-where-alternative-proteins-are-no-longer-alternative/,2021-05-11,"The Good Food Institute (GFI) has released its authoritative State of the Industry annual reports covering the plant-based, cellular agriculture and fermentation sectors with revealing results. The reports show that 2020 was the biggest year to date for sustainable protein company launches, private investments, and retail sales, confirming 2020 as a “record period of investment” for alt protein.  The GFI State of the Industry reports are deep dives into the key technologies, business developments, and scientific advances driving the industries, and the 2020 reports show Western Europe to be the largest regional market for plant-based meat at $1.8 billion, making up 43% of the global plant-based meat market. Additionally, global retail sales of plant-based meat hit record highs in 2020, reaching $4.2 billion, up from $3.4 billion in 2019. $2.2 billion was raised by US plant-based meat, egg, and dairy companies in 2020 – over 3X more than 2019. The reports also identified 23 new cell-cultured meat companies launching in 2020 – an increase of 43% YOY, and 13 new companies dedicated to using fermentation to make meat, eggs, dairy and seafood – 34% more than 2019. $366M was raised by cultivated meat companies in 2020 – 6X more than 219, and $587M was invested in fermentation companies in 2020 alone – more than half of the all-time investment in the segment. Although YOY growth continues to trend upwards, the reports hammer home the need for public-sector investment, echoing the views of Ezra Klein in his recent New York Times column. 2020 did see the first substantial public-sector R&D funding in both the US and the EU, including BioTech Foods‘ $3.2 million grant from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 programme, but the GFI warns that the alt protein market will remain a fraction of the overall market unless governments fund open-access R&D similar to other climate-friendly innovations.   ©BioTech Foods “The impressive slate of plant-based product releases, company launches, investments, science and technology innovations, and labeling wins in 2020 signals another year of continued growth and momentum ahead and brings us closer to realizing a world where alternative proteins are no longer alternative. While 2020 was a record-breaking year for plant-based proteins, more investment is needed – from both the public and the private sectors – to mitigate the environmental impact of conventional protein production, meet global climate goals, and sustainably feed a growing population,” states the report, which is available for download here.

9616,"Co-op Slashes Prices of Vegan Products, Says Eating Plant-Based “Shouldn’t Cost More Money”",https://vegconomist.com/food-and-beverage/co-op-slashes-prices-of-vegan-products-says-eating-plant-based-shouldnt-cost-more-money/,2021-05-10,"UK supermarket chain Co-op has dramatically reduced the cost of its vegan products to combat the “unfair” price disparity between plant-based and conventional foods. The products are now priced the same as their animal-based counterparts.  Burgers and sausages in the chain’s plant-based range, GRO, were formerly priced at £3 but have now more than halved in price. GRO vegan mince, also formerly £3, now costs £1.75. The reductions have been made possible by a £1.7m investment into the range. Altogether, the prices of 29 products have been slashed. The Co-op is hoping the move will not just save families money, but also cut carbon emissions — it is aiming for net-zero emissions by 2040. To help it achieve this target, it is also switching its home delivery vans to electric and ending the sale of plastic “bags for life”, which many customers don’t reuse. The higher cost of plant-based and cell-cultured products is a well-known barrier when it comes to convincing consumers to switch away from animal products. Several companies are now trying to address this. Impossible Foods has cut prices three times within the past year, for both foodservice and retail. Most recently, it cut recommended prices for US retail stores by about 20%. It plans to continuously lower prices through economies of scale, eventually underpricing animal products. VFC has also said it plans to underprice chicken, while companies such as Future Fields are aiming to slash the cost of cell-cultured meat. One Indian cultured meat company claims it has already achieved price parity. “It’s an industry-wide standard that plant-based alternatives are usually priced higher than their meat and dairy counterparts,” said Jo Whitfield, Co-op Food chief executive. “This disparity is unfair to those following vegetarian, vegan, and flexitarian diets. It’s Co-op’s ambition to make our plant-based range, GRO, even more accessible to our members and customers, helping them make decisions that collectively will have an impact on the world we all share,”    "
9620,ProteinX Foundation Names 15 Alt Protein Innovators as 2021 Awards Finalists,https://vegconomist.com/fairs-and-events/proteinx-foundation-names-15-alt-protein-innovators-as-2021-awards-finalists/,2021-05-07,"Silicon Valley-based foundation ProteinX was founded with the aim of fostering innovation in next-generation proteins. In November, it began the nomination process for its 2021 awards. Now, the finalists have been announced.  The awards recognise brands and individuals who are creating solutions for a more sustainable future through plant-based proteins. There are five categories — Corporations, Startups, Investors, Academia, and Thought Leaders. The 2021 finalists are as follows. Corporations: Nestle Nutrina, Coca-Cola, and Kerry. Kerry is an Irish dairy giant which has been making inroads into the plant-based sector, and was last year ranked #5 on the FAIRR list of companies actively supporting plant-based foods and beverages. Startups: Sundial Foods, Biomilq, and Because, Animals. The latter is an animal-free pet food startup that won last year’s Purina Prize. Biomilq, a maker of cultured breast milk, was featured in this year’s Future Food-Tech Summit. Investors: Big Idea Ventures, LeverVC, and AgFunder. Big Idea Ventures has a fund aimed at accelerating alt-protein startups, while LeverVC also launched a fund targeting the global alt-protein sector last year. Academia: UC Davis, Wageningen University, and Cornell University. UC Davis is notable because it received a $3.5M grant from the US government last September for cultured meat research. Thought Leaders: Dag Piper of The Kraft Heinz Company, Lisa Dyson, Ph.D. of AirProtein, and Rosie Wardle of Synthesis Capital. Kraft Heinz is supporting plant-based startups through its incubator program and is said to be developing vegan cheeses. Meanwhile, Dr. Dyson of Air Protein has won multiple awards for her work, and her innovative company has pioneered the process of developing meat from elements in the air. The three finalists in each category were selected by an extensive national and regional jury. Winners will be announced at the ProteinX Symposium, which will take place from June 8-10. There will also be speakers at the event discussing recent breakthroughs in cell-cultured meat, precision and biomass fermentation, new ingredients, and sustainable packaging. Tickets and further information are available from the foundation’s website.    "
9641,Change Foods: “Our Technology Allows For Endless Potential Within the Dairy Foods Space”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/change-foods-our-technology-allows-for-endless-potential-within-the-dairy-foods-space/,2021-05-04,"Earlier this year vegconomist reported on the hiring of Luis Espinoza, former VP of Manufacturing at Eat Just Inc, as COO of US/Australian food tech startup, Change Foods. A month previously, the fermentation specialists also announced the onboarding of Irina Gerry, formerly of Danone, to bring to market its dairy products made without the cow. With these two strategic hires, the company is on track to change the future of dairy.  vegconomist en español had the pleasure of speaking directly with Mr. Espinoza about his interesting story, how the health crisis has affected the industry, the mindset of consumers, and the prospects for the future of Change Foods. Tell us a little bit about yourself and your experience in the Plant-Based space and how you ended up at Change Foods.
With pleasure. I am originally from Mexico and all my professional career I have been involved in the food industry. I am a Food Industry Engineer graduated from Tecnológico de Monterrey (ITESM) in Mexico, and since before university, I already had a serious interest in food production, agriculture and human nutrition. I have been living in the United States for 11 years, where I arrived after the company where I worked offered me a good professional opportunity in the dairy industry and production of cheese, yogurt and other dairy products. At that time, I had the opportunity to be the general manager of three dairy manufacturing plants with approximately 400 employees and processing about 1.5 million litres of milk per day. It was during this time in the dairy industry that I fell in love with the cheese production process specifically, and I have great respect and admiration for all those who dedicate themselves to this noble craft. Also, during this period and for spiritual rather than health reasons, I decided to adopt a vegetarian and plant-based diet. It was for this philosophical reason that I decided to take a new professional opportunity with Amy’s Kitchen, a very special company to which I am very fond and to which I owe much of my learning in the natural and vegetarian food space. What differentiates Change Foods from other plant-based food companies?
Change Foods operates within the alternative protein space, where we seek to provide delicious and nutritious animal-free foods. There are now three pillars within the alternative protein space: plant-based, cell-based, and fermentation-based. Change Foods plays in the fermentation-based pillar. The biggest difference from plant-based foods that you may be familiar with today, such as almond milk, is that fermentation-based technology allows us to use precision-fermentation to use microorganisms to produce dairy proteins and other compounds. These compounds are bio-identical to their animal analogues, which means they are the same at a cellular level.  This enables us to create animal-free foods that taste and perform just like their animal-based predecessors, but without harming animals or taxing the planet. At Amy’s, I had the opportunity to start a new manufacturing plant for frozen foods and canned soups, either 100% plant-based or vegetarian products where some dairy products are used as ingredients. Amy’s uses no eggs, meat, fish or peanuts in any of its products. It was during my work as General Manager of the Amy’s plant that I became much more familiar with the development of new plant-based products and ingredients, working closely with the new product research and development team and launching a long list of innovative new products. In 2017 I decided to continue my professional development even more, specialising in the plant-based food industry, and after meeting Josh Tetrick, founder and CEO of Eat Just, I was captivated by his vision for the future of the world’s food production system and was very inspired. For this reason, I decided to leave Amy’s to join Just’s executive team and its mission, fulfilling my role as Vice President of Manufacturing. At Just I had the opportunity to learn a lot about the process of vegetable protein production, from Pea Protein to Mung Bean protein, as well as its application in the development of several highly innovative products, such as egg replacer, among other applications. It was in late 2017 that he made the decision to co-found and take on the responsibility of CEO of a Cannabis production company in California. The company started as “Kind Farms Inc”, but we rebranded to POSIBL, in which we are dedicated to designing the farm of the future using technologies that in other times would have been unaffordable to apply in agriculture, but thanks to the economies of this crop and the commoditization of various technologies, it was possible for us to integrate “Hi-Tech” greenhouses. This production system uses significantly fewer resources, especially energy and water, and is an organic production system without the introduction of chemical pesticides, in addition, we use artificial intelligence and Machine Learning to improve daily decision making and optimise plant performance with less input and labour. In June 2020 I decided to leave my day-to-day involvement in the cannabis industry, staying on as a board director and shareholder, to return to the food industry. At the end of August, I had the opportunity to read an article about a company called Change Foods, based in Australia, that was doing amazing things in the food technology, alternative protein, and dairy processing industry, so I decided to contact its founder and CEO, David Bucca, directly to talk to him about it. After a couple of long conversations with David, it became clear to me that his vision for the future and the company’s mission aligned perfectly with my own vision for the industry, and the issues I am passionate about. Instantly there was a great connection between the two of us, I really liked his leadership and personality and we clicked well, so David invited me to join Change Foods’ external advisory group and collaborate in this way. Working as an advisor for several months with David, and other members of the team, his leadership style became clear to me and it was this that really motivated me to join as a full operations manager, and I couldn’t be happier to be part of this great mission and the great team we are building. How has the health crisis affected Change Foods’ performance?
COVID exposed many vulnerabilities in our current food supply systems, including disease-spreading potential, inequities in the treatment of workers, and supply chain insecurity. COVID also further exposed the connection between our diet and health. In the US, where the average American diet is heavy in processed and animal-based foods, people’s health was affected to a much greater degree by COVID than in other nations. During COVID many consumers began to refocus their attention on diet and food supply. All of these trends create greater awareness and demand for cleaner, healthier and more sustainable alternatives. Change Foods is on a mission to create a world with a thriving and sustainable food system that is kind to people, animals and the planet. What else is there for Change Foods in the future? what other product lines can we expect from you in the future?
Although we are starting with animal-free cheese, our technology allows for endless potential within the dairy foods space. We are evaluating products like animal-free milk, yogurt and ice cream for our expansion opportunities.    "
9644,Meat Processing Giant Tyson Foods Introduces New Plant-Based Products Amid Greenwashing Concerns ,https://vegconomist.com/products-and-launches/meat-processing-giant-tyson-foods-introduces-new-plant-based-products-amid-greenwashing-concerns/,2021-05-04,"Raised & Rooted, the plant-based brand produced by Tyson Foods – the second biggest animal meat company in the world after Brazil’s JBS – is expanding its range with three new products. Tyson this week enters the market with new plant-based burger patties, vegan ground beef, and two types of sausage, meaning serious business – with a rollout into an incredible 10,000 US retail locations.  After the failure of its hybrid beef and pea protein burger, and its non-vegan “plant-based” chicken nuggets which contained eggs, as discontinued last year, Tyson is back with more offerings. The company is the world’s second-largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork, and annually is the largest US beef exporter. With such capital and infrastructure, it comes as no surprise to find the Raised & Rooted brand entering a number of locations as high as 10,000, as well as online, with plans to expand globally from the US into Europe. With US sales of plant-based meat, dairy, and eggs outpacing sales of animal products for the third year running, Tyson Foods has made no secret of its plans to enter the plant-based meat sphere and compete directly with the likes of Beyond Meat – a company with which it has a rocky history after being an early investor then selling shares before Beyond’s famous IPO in 2019. In February, Beyond announced a three-year deal with McDonald’s, which is one of Tyson’s biggest customers as supplier of poultry meat. “We haven’t really seen in the marketplace any brands owned by Hormel or Tyson get much traction,” Dennis Woodside, President of Impossible Foods told Bloomberg. He estimated Beyond and Impossible have over 80% of the core fresh plant-based ground beef category. “All the other players are falling by the wayside.” Throughout its history, Tyson Foods has been marred by scandals regarding the environment and, naturally, animal cruelty. According to data the company submitted to the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Toxic Release Inventory, Tyson Foods was allegedly the second biggest polluter of America’s waterways from 2010 to 2014. While some commentators argue that big business entering the plant-based sector is good for the growth of both the market and the movement, others continue to warn of the dangers of greenwashing. “Our products are plants made meatier, and deliver the same delicious flavors, in a better-for-you alternative,” said David Ervin, vice president of marketing, Raised & Rooted. “We are excited to provide people with satisfying alternative protein options perfect for any occasion.”    "
9648,Sophie’s Bionutrients Develops World’s First Milk Made From Algae,https://vegconomist.com/food-and-beverage/sophies-bionutrients-develops-worlds-first-milk-made-from-algae/,2021-05-04,"Sophie’s Bionutrients, a Singapore-based food technology company co-founded by Eugene Wang of Sophie’s Kitchen, announces today that it has developed the first-ever microalgae-based milk. The company describes itself as the world’s first food tech company to use microalgae to develop 100% plant-based and sustainable alternative protein with the core vision that microalgae is the superfood of the future.  As we reported in March, Wang was first inspired to launch the brand due to the fact that fish get their nutrients from algae, and so he began working on a microalgae-based flour that other companies could use to make alt-protein products. The company states that the product is comparable in nutritional value to cow’s milk but that the protein value can be elevated by up to 50% by altering ratios in the water-soluble micro-algae flour, and further that that the alt-milk has a similar texture to nut-based milk but can be further refined to mimic the creamy texture of dairy. The milk was made with Sophie’s Bionutrients’ signature micro-algae protein flour with the same essential amino acids as microalgae. Prepared in-house in a protected environment, Sophie’s micro-algae has a whole-wheat flour colour that can take on unlimited forms, textures or colours. Thus, from burger patties to alt milk, Sophie’s Bionutrients micro-algae flour can be used to develop almost any food. Furthermore, the micro-algae is self-sustaining and can be fed food waste such as spent grains, okara and molasses during the fermentation process – creating a sustainable, circular production method. Nurturing the micro-algae in a protected environment also allows for output ten times higher than conventional sunshine pond operations, reducing the cultivation costs usually associated with micro-algae farming. “We believe in harnessing the power of nature to build a sustainable, greener future through environment-friendly alternate food solutions. We believe that micro-algae is the best place to help us achieve this.  It is the superfood of the future. Through further refinement with food and beverage producing partners developments like this one, the world’s first allergen-free micro-algae milk, we believe we can transform the way we live, produce and consume food for the better,” said Wang.

9649,“Massive Growth” of Alt Protein Field in Israel as Total Investment Increases 8X Since 2018,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/massive-growth-of-the-alt-protein-field-in-israel-as-total-investment-increases-8x-since-2014/,2021-05-03,"  According to a new GFI Israel study, the total investment in companies developing alt proteins in Israel has increased eightfold across the plant-based, cell-cultured and fermentation fields. The total of all investments in 2020 was almost three times higher than the previous year, with 154% annual growth (YOY).  As global investments in alt protein companies reached $3.1 billion in 2020 – three times higher than in 2019 – the GFI has identified Israel as playing a key role in the alt protein movement, with record-breaking numbers and capital investments reaching $114 million. Between 2018 and 2020 the total investment in companies developing alt proteins rocketed from $14 million in 2018 to $114 million in 2020. Additionally, in 2020: Plant-based meat, egg, and dairy companies received $77 million in investments. Cultivated meat companies received $16 million. Fermentation companies devoted to alternative proteins received $21 million. Findings also recently revealed that the growth of the alt protein market in Israel was 13 times greater than that for animal products in 2020, with the Israeli alternative meat market growing by about 24% overall. The latest GFI report backs this up by revealing the “Massive growth” of the alt protein field when compared to other industries, with an average annual investment growth of 187% and a huge advantage over other leading high-tech industries in Israel. Israel aims to position itself at the forefront of the global alt protein market, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu making a well-publicised trip to Aleph Farms’ facilities and becoming the first world leader to sample cell-cultured meat. In another example of the aforementioned investment, Israeli startup Chunk Foods last week raised $2 million in a pre-seed funding round to develop its fermentation technology to produce whole-muscle meat alternatives. Cell-cultured leader MeaTech also recently announced its $25 million IPO and Nasdaq listing, which you can read a vegconomist interview regarding here. “GFI Israel focuses on advancing alternative protein innovation in the “Startup Nation”. Israel is recognized as a world leader in agricultural research, tissue engineering, stem cell research and engineering and thus has emerged as a hub for alternative protein innovation and cultivated meat companies. Israel is ranked 2nd in the world (after the United States) in the number of fermentation companies (10) and cellular agriculture companies (9). “As this industry is still in its infancy, we are expecting to see more emerging startups and bigger investments being made as mature companies scale up, in the coming years. Startups in Israel are no longer in a rush for an exit, and although their target market is in most cases overseas, they have learned to scale effectively and build global brands. This is why we see more and more tier 1 international investors active in Israel,” says Aviv Oren, Business Engagement Manager at GFI Israel.    "

In 2017, Orkla’s Swedish vegan brand Anamma partnered with McDonald’s to create the McVegan Burger in Sweden to tap into what the company saw as a “strong trend” towards plant-based. The following year, the conglomerate launched a wide range of new products across Europe, including many vegan alternatives in addition to its existing portfolio of products through its subsidiaries, which include the Naturli brand. By 2025, the group states that it aims to reach NOK 3 billion – around $360M – in sales of plant-based foods, through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Elin Tveito Lidman was appointed CEO of Orkla Alternative Proteins (OAP), having 14 years of experience from various Orkla companies. Under her leadership, OAP will work closely with the various Orkla Food Ingredients and Orkla Foods companies that currently develop, market and sell plant-based foods. “More and more consumers want healthier, more sustainable alternatives to traditional meat and dairy products. Technological advances will enable us to develop new products that are at least as good in terms of taste, texture and nutritional content. The potential in our current home markets and in new areas is considerable,” says Lidman. “We are only at the beginning of a massive shift towards alternative protein sources. For Orkla, alternative proteins are an important focus area that offers great opportunities for growth. Our goal is to reach everyone with plant-based foods and make sure they can choose these products without sacrificing taste or consistency. We want to make it easier to choose healthy, sustainable alternatives to meat and dairy products as part of your daily diet,” says Orkla President and CEO Jaan Ivar Semlitsch.    "

Hosted by ProVeg, the event brought together a range of key stakeholders in the industry.  The conference first took place in 2019, but was this year expanded to cover the entire plant-based product value chain — including agriculture, manufacturing, retail, investment, and innovation. Over 50 speakers were featured, and there were more than 400 participants. Representatives from major food brands, startups, NGOs, and academia attended the conference, as well as industry experts. Among them were JUST’s Josh Tetrick, Beyond Meat’s Will Schafer, and Oatly’s Cecilia McAleavey. For McAleavey, the focus was on sustainability. “We all know based on scientific facts that we need to promote a shift to a plant-based food system. In the end, it’s our kids and future generations that lose,” she said. Meanwhile, Schafer discussed the inspiration behind Beyond Meat — making plant-based meat appeal to omnivores. “You don’t change the world by selling less meat to vegetarians,” he said. Tetrick said his vision was for a world where eating meat didn’t involve killing an animal. He added that JUST aimed to launch its egg alternative in Europe by the end of the year. “Our goal [is] to be the most consumed egg in the world. It is more healthy, you don’t need the chicken,” he said. McAleavey, ProVeg International Vice President Jasmijn de Boo, and Portuguese MEP Francisco Guerreiro also held a discussion about the controversial amendment AM171, which would put huge restrictions on the marketing of dairy alternatives. “AM171 was a desperate move from the meat and dairy industry to stop the natural growth of plant-based products,” said Guerreiro. But a ProVeg petition to stop AM171 has now gained 450,000 signatures, leading to hopes that it will be scrapped. 34 politicians have also urged the European Parliament to drop the amendment. “You can’t ignore over half a million citizens,” said de Boo.

The cookies are made with pumpkin and nutritional yeast.  They also contain beta-glucan, proven to boost immunity, as well as barley, applesauce, maple syrup, and coconut oil. They are available from the company’s website and some pet retailers. Because, Animals has recently redesigned its e-commerce site and revamped its packaging to be made from recycled water bottles. It has also updated its logo, adding a comma to the company name. Last year, Because, Animals won the Purina Pet Care Innovation Prize, receiving a sum of $10,000, business mentorship, and participation in a pet care business accelerator boot camp. In an interview with vegconomist in 2019, co-founder and CEO Dr. Shannon Falconer said cultured meat was “a safer and more nutritious alternative to pet food made with animal-grown meat.” Animal-free pet food is a growing market, and companies in this area have been increasingly successful. In the UK, plant-based pet food company THE PACK has attracted a huge number of investors, as has Bond Pet Foods in the US. “Pumpkin Noochies+ are loaded with healthy ingredients, but we’ve come to think of yeast-derived beta-glucan as a magical ingredient for immunity and promoting overall physical health,” said Falconer. “Perhaps more importantly, dogs love the winning combination of umami from nutritional yeast and the sweetness of maple syrup paired with apples, pumpkin, and barley.”    "

But Silicon Valley-based Orbillion Bio, fresh out of Y Combinator’s accelerator program, is targeting a different niche.  The startup is working on heritage meats such as bison, elk, lamb, and wagyu beef, attracting the attention of numerous investors. In Orbillion’s recent oversubscribed seed funding round, firms such as At One Ventures, k16 ventures, and FoundersX Ventures contributed to help raise a total of $5M. The company says the funding will go towards pilot production of its cultured wagyu beef. Orbillion Bio was founded by Patricia Bubner, Gabriel Levesque-Tremblay, and Samet Yildirim, who have a total of thirty years’ experience in bioprocessing and biopharmaceuticals. On March 17, Orbillion held a public tasting event where it presented its cultured wagyu beef, elk, and lamb. A few days later, CEO Patricia Bubner gave a presentation to investors at Y Combinator’s “Demo Day”, resulting in a huge surge of interest in the company. Previously, Orbillion showcased its bioplatform for the functional testing of cell lines at The Future Food-Tech Summit last December. Like Singapore’s Singcell and Canada’s Future Fields, it is looking to address the cost and scalability issues associated with cultured meat. “We love to see teams that are focused on the right things, and Orbillion is a great example,” said Ali Rohde, GP at Outset Capital. “They’re completely focused on the flavor and the science.

9657,Israeli Company Chunk Foods Raises $2M to Develop Whole Cut Alt-Meat Products,https://vegconomist.com/investments/israeli-company-chunk-foods-raises-2m-to-develop-whole-cut-alt-meat-products/,2021-04-30,"Israeli startup Chunk Foods has raised $2M in a pre-seed funding round led by venture fund Stray Dog Capital. The startup uses fermentation technology to produce whole-muscle meat alternatives.  While there now exists a large number of alt-meat producers, the focus tends to be on alternatives to processed meat, such as burgers, meatballs, and nuggets. Making whole cuts of meat is challenging, and few companies have attempted it. Spotting a gap in the market, Chunk Foods decided to use solid-state fermentation to make beef alternatives containing only natural ingredients. It plans to use the new funding to improve its products and hire new staff. Investor Stray Dog Capital specialises in alternative protein investments and has previously provided funding to Beyond Meat, Grounded Foods, and Barvecue, among others. There are a few other companies working to make whole alt-meat cuts possible — Paris-based Umiami has recently unveiled a proprietary texturisation process to create plant-based whole cuts, while US company Meati Foods has made steak from mycelium. Last year, food scientists at the University of Massachusetts received a grant from GFI to make alt-meat products more like whole cuts of conventional meat. However, none of these approaches use fermentation. “Whole muscle cuts of beef such as sirloin, chuck or ribs have been the Holy Grail for alternative meats as they account for about 60% of the beef market in the USA,” says Amos Golan, founder and CEO of Chunk Foods. “We have overcome the technological limitations of other approaches by naturally creating delicious and realistic products with many of the attributes of meat, while ensuring a clean and short ingredient list using our novel fermentation technology. Stray Dog Capital shares our vision of the future of food and we’re excited to be partnering to make that vision into reality.”    "

We were pleased to speak with Business Development Executive Simon Fried to talk about what drives the company, the cell-cultured space, and the food production and agriculture of tomorrow. Could you tell us a little about your personal background and your journey to MeaTech and the cell-cultured world?
The cultured meat sector fascinates me because of its potential to create real change. New food technologies can transform our relationship with nature while also changing how the business and logistical aspects of agriculture function. I spent many years as a consultant to large food brands and food retailers before working in high-tech. During the many years working at Nano Dimension, a 3D printing company I co-founded, I came across 3D bioprinting. At the time, 3D bioprinting was limited to drug discovery and other more experimental applications. These different experiences coalesce at MeaTech. Creating the technologies for the meat factories of the future is an inspiring goal whose success would make a meaningful impact. MeaTech recently hit the headlines with news of its $25 million IPO in the US and NASDAQ approval, can you reveal the latest developments in this process?
Even though MeaTech was already listed on the Tel Aviv stock exchange, listing on the NASDAQ was no small endeavor. The whole company came together to ensure a rapid and smooth process. We are proud we completed the listing so quickly and raised a significant round. Over the course of the listing, our R&D team continued their work and today, we are still focusing on developing our bovine and avian cell technologies as well as on continuing development of our bioprinting systems. Having been traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange for over a year now, MeaTech became the world’s very first public cell-cultured company. What did that mean to your business?
Being the first publicly traded cultured meat company has been instrumental to our strategy. MeaTech is dual-listed, where it has been publicly traded in Tel Aviv for over a year and recently joined the NASDAQ in the first quarter of 2021. M&A activities, for example, are a more straightforward proposition. We’ve already made a synergistic acquisition, a cultured avian meat company in Belgium called ‘Peace of Meat’ that has already paid off in terms of advancing our development. Beyond Meat’s publicly traded status helped bring the entire alternative protein sector to the forefront of public consciousness. We think cultured meat can benefit from the same attention and aspire to bring a similar level of awareness to our niche of the alternative protein sector. With such an emerging industry, names and labels are yet to be formalised, though “cell-cultured” has been approved in the US by the FDA. How do you feel about the cell-cultured label? Is there any other nomenclature that you would prefer?
There is an old Swedish saying that ‘a dear child has many names’ and it is certainly the case with this industry. The terminology evolution is interesting: in the early days, when cultured meat still hadn’t really made the leap from academic labs, in-vitro and lab-grown were the most common terms. While accurate, the terms are about as appetizing as calling yoghurt a bacterial fermentation. Over time, the industry adopted terms that would be more ‘palatable’ to the public, like cell-cultured, cultured, clean, cultivated, cell-based and animal-cell based. I think the latest labels are doing a better job of communicating to consumers, investors, and stakeholders. At MeaTech we tend to refer to the process as cell-based agriculture, and the end-product as cultured meat. Terminology is changing due to marketing, business and political considerations. There are those arguing against labeling plant-based proteins as meat because they contend it is literally incorrect. I believe consumers can decipher such things on their own. Others believe cultured meat shouldn’t be called meat either, even though it is made of the very same ingredients as conventional beef! MeaTech focuses on developing and out-licensing proprietary 3D printing technology to manufacture proteins, how did you arrive at this business model?
The company believes in the potential for cultured meat to have a dramatic impact on business models, products, consumer habits, and sustainability. Developing such technology requires a great deal of expertise across a range of disciplines and we believe that enabling the production of cultured meat by licensing the production technologies is a powerful way to accelerate widespread adoption. MeaTech recently acquired Belgian cultured fat producer Peace of Meat. What was the drive behind this acquisition? Can we expect more acquisitions in the future?
MeaTech was initially focused on cultured beef, where our team in Israel is focusing on bovine cell line technologies. The company aspires to offer a range of cell types and is exploring routes to achieve this. Chicken is clearly a key market. Rather than developing the capabilities from the ground up, we searched for a company we felt had the best technologies, would be a good fit, and would complement our capabilities. Peace of Meat has a world-class scientific and business team as well as impressive cell-culturing technologies. The MeaTech group is now working on multi-species solutions, and as announced, it is also exploring alternatives in the aquaculture space. Meanwhile Peace of Meat is focusing on scaling up production of cultured chicken fat as an ingredient in hybrid plant/cell-based products. The myriad benefits of cell-cultured meat are well documented, do you believe this technology could dramatically change the world’s relationship to food production?
We go to work knowing what we are doing has the potential to drive real change. The impact on the environment and ethical considerations are indeed clear but it is also important to look at the additional societal and business advantages. Cultured meat may be safer and cleaner and may ensure as well as reshape supply chains. We believe cultured meat and other new food technologies, like precision fermentation, will ultimately change the relationship between food production and agriculture. Tomorrow’s agriculture will probably require much less land, have a much smaller environmental footprint, and ensure more local and flexible supply.    "
9683,"Bill Gates, Ezra Klein and the GFI Call on Congress for Public Investment in Alt-Proteins in Face of Climate Crisis ",https://vegconomist.com/politics-law/bill-gates-ezra-klein-and-the-gfi-call-on-congress-for-public-investment-in-alt-proteins-in-face-of-climate-crisis/,2021-04-27,"As Ezra Klein calls on policymakers to make open-access research into plant-based and cell-cultured meat a key part of the American Jobs Plan and climate strategy, the GFI is strongly advocating for $2 billion in funds for open-access alt-protein science. The international nonprofit has also worked with Bill Gates‘ NGO Breakthrough Energy calling for public investment in alt-proteins as a key climate mitigation strategy.  US journalist and political analyst Klein, who previously co-founded Vox, has called for government action in his New York Times column: “At its heart, the American Jobs Plan is a climate bill. But there isn’t a dollar for alternative proteins, despite animal agriculture’s huge contributions to both climate and pandemic risk. That’s worse than a mistake. It’s a failure of policy design. Luckily, it’s easily fixed.” The GFI is calling on the Biden-Harris transition policy recommendations team to invest $2 billion in funds for open-access alternative protein science, in order to tackle key white spaces to accelerate the growth of the sector. It has also written to Congress to appropriate $100m for plant-based and cultivated meat R&D, representing a coalition of 61 companies, nonprofits, and trade associations. “Although private investment in alternative proteins is growing, open-access public research is crucial to accelerate growth. Public research will have a significantly broader impact on innovation and the economy by creating jobs and generating new opportunities to feed Americans and the world, rather than primarily benefiting specific companies,” explains the GFI in its letter to Congress. The GFI has also worked with US Climate Advisers on a policy report outlining specific actions to leverage alt-protein’s potential to deliver 14 to 20 percent of the emissions mitigation needed by 2050. Central to each action is increased investment in open-access science and increased global collaboration. Breakthrough Energy – the net-zero emissions NGO set up by Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg, Richard Branson, Jack Ma and others – has worked with the GFI on their federal policy priorities, putting increased federal investment in alt-proteins R&D at the top of the list, including plant proteins, cellular agriculture, and microbial fermentation.  “It will be scientifically impossible for governments to meet their obligations under the Paris Climate Agreement to decarbonize the global economy unless the amount of meat produced via conventional animal agriculture significantly declines. With global livestock contributing an estimated 14.5 percent of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, our current food production methods are not efficient enough to meet the growing global demand for protein and reach zero emissions by 2050,” explained the GFI regarding its work with Breakthrough Energy.

9702,"MeaTech, The First Publicly Traded Cultured Meat Company, Announces Financial Results",https://vegconomist.com/trade/meatech-the-first-publicly-traded-cultured-meat-company-announces-financial-results/,2021-04-22,"The first publicly traded cultured meat company, MeaTech, which develops cell cultured meat production capabilities including its proprietary three-dimensional printing technology, biotechnology processes, and customizable manufacturing processes for slaughter-free real meat manufacturing, today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020. Its 2020 year-end cash position was $13.5 million ($8.5 million pro-forma to POM acquisition) with a further $28 million raised as part of the Nasdaq listing, bringing current cash position to $33.5 million. In addition to several funding rounds in 2020 totaling $15 million, MeaTech raised $28 million in a public offering of ADSs on the Nasdaq in March 2021. MeaTech is the first cultured meat company to be publicly traded in the US. This week, its subsidiary MeaTech Europe, has commenced food technology development activities, with an initial focus on hybrid foods, which are food offerings composed of both plant and cultured fat and/or protein ingredients. One of MeaTech Europe’s main activities will be food technology development on behalf of the MeaTech group of companies. The initial focus will be to facilitate the development of a variety of hybrid food offerings based on chicken fat from MeaTech 3D’s recently acquired Antwerp-based subsidiary Peace of Meat BV. Food technology development activities will focus on enhancing Peace of Meat’s cultured chicken cell products, including optimizing key aspects like taste, texture, flavor, mouthfeel, and nutrition. In February 2021, MeaTech finalized its acquisition of Peace of Meat BV, a Belgian producer of cultured avian products, for $17.7 million in cash and equity. MeaTech intends to leverage Peace of Meat’s cultured avian technologies to diversify its current bovine-oriented technologies and expedite its entry into the market for cultured real meat protein and meat products. The Peace of Meat acquisition broadens the MeaTech portfolio by adding chicken fat and other cultured avian products to the MeaTech family of pipeline offerings. The cultured avian meat products and the technologies used to make them are expected to be marketed to food processing companies looking to add more meatiness to their plant-based offerings. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, Peace of Meat’s management will continue to lead the development process at the company’s headquarters in Belgium. Sharon Fima, MeaTech’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are pleased with our execution throughout 2020. I would like to thank our wonderful management team and employees who worked tirelessly to ensure our continued growth despite a challenging year. Continued Mr. Fima, “The world is looking for more sustainable agriculture practices, and we believe cultured meats – created without slaughtering livestock – can be a significant advancement towards that goal. MeaTech has become the first cultured meat company to be publicly traded, and is now also on the Nasdaq. We also completed the highly synergistic acquisition of Peace of Meat, a Belgian developer of cultured avian technologies, which strongly grows our addressable markets and is expected to provide an earlier entry point into the burgeoning cultured meat industry.” Concluded Mr. Fima, “With the technology we are creating, we expect to see real meat grown in clean, controlled conditions in just months, instead of the years it takes to produce farm-raised meat. In addition to having the potential to be a more sustainable production process, cultured meat can be produced anywhere on the planet, changing supply chains. The past few months have seen great momentum for MeaTech, and we are very excited about the strategic initiatives we have in place. We look forward to further building MeaTech, establishing ourselves as global leaders and a hub for innovation in the cultured meat industry.”    "
9715,GFI Brazil: “Brazil is Going to Be at the Center of the Most Relevant Debate of Our Century”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/gfi-brazil-brazil-is-going-to-be-at-the-center-of-the-most-relevant-debate-of-our-century/,2021-04-20,"Brazil, Latin America’s leading economic power, has been hit hard by the Covid crisis. In 2020, GDP fell 1.4% from the previous year, not to mention the enormous human cost inflicted by the pandemic. However, the country’s central bank forecasts that national GDP will grow 3.6% this year, and despite the consequences of the crisis on so many levels, Brazil remains a regional focus for innovation in the area of alternative proteins.  To hear the voice of a true expert in this sector, we spoke with Gus Guadagnini, CEO of The Good Food Institute in Brazil, an organisation that promotes and facilitates the transition to an animal-free food system. Please tell us a little bit about yourself and how you came to The Good Food Institute Brazil.
I’m a business person who worked mainly in big corporations, focusing on innovation and opening new business units in Brazil. Entrepreneurship, consumer habits and technology trends always inspired me in my career. After seven years working in my previous job, I decided to turn my career around and follow my desire to contribute more to our planet. My wish was especially to contribute to the animal cause since I was already a vegan at the time. My life-changing journey took me to some exciting consultancy projects for impact-focused startups. Still, I wanted to focus on my own cause. After a while, I ended up being connected to Bruce Friedrich, who had started GFI US just a few months before. We decided to test Brazil as a possible second location for GFI. This is how my story began in the Institute! I started GF BR on February 1st, coincidentally precisely one year after the official launch date of GFI US.  What role does GFI have with regards to businesses and entrepreneurship in Brazil and other countries in Latin America? 
Our Corporate Engagement Team (CE) builds collaborative relationships with the largest food producers (including meat companies), startups, investors and retailers to maximize the availability, quality, quantity, and promotion of plant-based meat. We don’t just inform people about these fields, but we provide them with crucial information on the market, including consumer knowledge. For example, we map out “white spaces” in all animal-free meat, egg, and dairy fields, showing where there are opportunities. We open-source research and the current state of science and engineering so that no one has to start from scratch and reinvent the wheel. In short, GFI is a think tank for plant-based and cultivated meat fields. In addition to inspiring and recruiting new people to these fields, we help build founding teams and start new companies. Once we have enabled to build these teams, we provide a variety of services, from marketing and branding to business plans and public relations. GFI connects these new companies to sources of funding and provides guidance on regulatory issues. We also help build coalitions of new and existing companies to understand and address regulatory issues. In this way, GFI acts as an accelerator for the plant-based and cultivated meat market sectors. GFI also engages with foundations, corporations, investors, and governments and explains the value of research and development (and mergers and acquisitions) in this field, especially as a critical component in addressing public health, sustainability, climate change, and global hunger. These efforts seek to shift tens of millions of dollars in government and foundation grant money toward animal-free meat, eggs, and dairy. Already, our efforts have helped spur significant investments in – and even acquisitions of – plant-based and cultivated meat companies by some of the world’s largest food companies, giving these companies greater resources and expertise to develop their products and bring them to market more quickly and broadly. We also lead the efforts to fight back against the reactionary and protectionist attempts by some entrenched interests. GFI exposes efforts to hinder the development and marketing of animal-free meat, eggs, and dairy while providing a voice for progress and innovation to journalists and others. We are working with legislators and regulators to ensure a clear and efficient path to market for cultivated meat. The Good Food Institute is helping to fundamentally change the food system, accelerating the shift from industrial animal agriculture to animal-free meat, eggs, and dairy. We do all of the above not only in Brazil but also in the United States, Asia-Pacific, Europe, India and Israel. In Brazil, we were the first part talking about alternative protein. We are proud to be an essential part of all the most relevant projects in the region, such as the startup Fazenda Futuro and also the investments made by large corporations like JBS. We are also partners for the investment community, like the VC Enfiny and retail, such as GPA. We are the principal government advisor about this subject and the leading advocacy for science in the region. Would you be able to give us your personal assessment of how the plant-based foods sector is developing in Brazil compared to North America and Europe?
The alternative protein sector will grow exponentially in the coming years, both in Brazil and worldwide. However, Brazilian agribusiness is incredibly well developed, supplying the whole world with grains, vegetables, and animal products. Besides that, the consumers in the region are very open to plant protein. Therefore, I can say that the sector is developing much faster here and that this trend will be sustained in the coming years. Only a couple of years ago, we had almost nothing in the meat analog market, and today Brazil already exports to more than 15 countries. This fast-growing market, as I mentioned, is due to the vocation that we already had for the agri-food sector, counting with excellent scientists, large meat and food companies, established logistics networks, among other factors.  About consumer acceptance, GFI commissioned research in Brazil last year to find that 50% of the local population is already reducing meat consumption. Besides that, 37% already included plant-based meat in their routine, and only 7% never would consume plant-based products. At the same time, the economy in Brazil and Latin America is still suffering the effects of COVID 19, and it is not showing signs that it will be back to pre-pandemic levels much soon. This is why we believe that the exportation business will play a vital role in the growth and development of plant-based companies in the region in the next couple of years.  In synthesis, while excellent consumer acceptance and pre-existing infrastructure is growing the alternative protein markets both in Brazil and Latin America, it is clear that the local economy is under pressure and will take a while to recover. How do you see the future playing out for the plant-based foods and cell-cultured meat sector in Brazil and Latin America?
About plant-based: During the first years of the industry, our region is trying to cover the product and technology gap between what we have here and in more developed markets. This task is in an advanced stage since Brazil and other countries like Chile are already producing some of the most delicious plant-based products globally. Everything points in the direction of keeping a robust private investment in the area. Considering that, I believe next years will bring a more specific view about the region and how it can play a unique role in the alternative protein sector. Latin America is the home of the largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon, and there is tremendous potential to develop new ingredients using its biodiversity. The same applies to other areas of the region, such as the Cerrado biome in Brazil. We will soon be eating new sources of proteins, fats and fibers that come directly from the Latin American biodiversity and add a second layer of sustainability for the industry. Besides the positive effects of replacing animal products, our industry can create a local-based economy that will support producing communities and create a financial incentive to keep the forests alive.  Not only will the forest be part of this game, but also the local grains and vegetable productions. Last week, the meat giant BRF launched a new product that uses Brazilian beans as a source of protein. This is a trend that I bet to see spreading throughout the whole region: the prioritization of local ingredients produced closer to the manufacturing facilities of the food industry and that are already traditionally part of the local culture. About cultivated meat: this is an area that has just started in the region and probably will be driven by the large meat manufacturers that are very present in Latin America and have enough resources to invest in high technology. BRF already announces that their cultivated meat product will be made in partnership with the Israeli startup Aleph Farms. Following this announcement, it is very likely that other major corporations will be joining the sector and investing heavily to dispute the local market. It is a newer area but still very prominent, and it can also benefit from the thousands of animal species present in the region’s biodiversity. Is there anything you would like to tell our readers who are considering starting or expanding their own business in the plant-based or cell-cultured meat industry in Brazil? 
Brazil is not a simple market: it is a continental country with a complex logistic system, a hard-to-understand and onerous tax environment, complex laws, a low-income average among the population, and it is not entirely stable politically. However, it is also a large consumer market, with a solid tradition for buying animal products and high acceptance of alternative substitutes. It also has a world-leading food industry and established distribution for the whole planet. In addition, the country is also very well served by impressive scientists with decades of knowledge in the food area, has strong universities and a solid workforce capability for the sector. Brazil is also going to be at the center of the most relevant debate of our century: preserving biodiversity and forests such as the Amazon. Therefore, starting a business that collaborates with this goal may put companies and entrepreneurs in a unique position to profit in a way that can also collaborate to the world’s most pressing environmental issues. My takeaway: starting a business in Brazil may not be easy, but it is worth the effort. Suppose the company is based on innovation and wants to grow in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way. In that case, Brazil may be the ideal home for it.     "

Eat Just has teamed up with foodpanda, Asia’s leading food and grocery delivery platform, to launch the world’s first home delivery of cell-cultured meat.  To celebrate Earth Day on April 22nd, diners will be able to place orders for three GOOD Meat Cultured Chicken dishes via the foodpanda app, with each order packaged in sustainable bamboo packaging and delivered by e-bike. Singapore became the first country to approve cell-cultured meat, and Eat Just – the company that applies cutting-edge science and technology to create healthier, more sustainable foods – sold its first GOOD Meat dishes in Singapore’s 1880 restaurant, which will also be preparing the latest home delivery meals.  Reactions around cell-cultured meat have been positive since GOOD Meat’s launch in Singapore so far. According to research, 70% of Singaporeans who have sampled GOOD Meat said that it tasted as good, or better than animal chicken, and nearly 90% of those diners said they would substitute animal chicken with cell-cultured chicken. GOOD Meat and foodpanda plan to collaborate with additional restaurants in Singapore to offer new dishes for delivery in the months to come. Starting in mid-May, GOOD Meat selections from JW Marriott Singapore South Beach will be available on the platform. The venture capital fund of Delivery Hero – foodpanda’s parent company – DX ventures is currently an investor in Eat Just. “Food is at the core of our business, and ensuring that we have a sustainable food ecosystem is an important agenda for us. foodpanda is thrilled to be the first platform in the world to deliver cultured meat dishes so that customers in Singapore can be the world’s first diners to enjoy them from the comforts of their home,” said Jakob Angele, CEO of foodpanda APAC. “Together with Eat Just, we hope to bring this to more markets – not just in Asia but also in every country in the world where Delivery Hero brands operate.”      "
9725,Evo Foods Celebrates One of Largest Ever Seed Funding Rounds by an Indian Food Startup With a Stellar List of Investors,https://vegconomist.com/investments/evo-foods-celebrates-one-of-largest-ever-seed-funding-rounds-by-an-indian-food-startup-with-a-stellar-list-of-investors/,2021-04-19,"Recent data from the PBFA and GFI revealed that plant-based eggs grew 168% in 2020, nearly ten times the rate of poultry eggs. India’s Evo Foods was thus clever and lucky enough to have selected the fastest-growing plant-based category, which saw dollar sales surging 192% between 2019 – 2020, outperforming both Oatly and Beyond Meat. Evo’s recent pre-seed round is reportedly one of the largest ever by an early-stage food startup in India.  The global egg replacement market was worth $966 million in 2016 and is estimated to reach $1373.4 million by 2023, so a list of high profile investors including Ryan Bethencourt’s Sustainable Food Ventures, Michiel Van Deursen‘s Capital V, VegInvest, and Dr. Sandhya Sriram of Shiok Meats have been keen early investors. New investors in this round include Stephanie Downs of Material Innovation Initiative, Sweden’s Kale United, and members of the US- based Glasswall Syndicate. A billion eggs are produced every year in India alone. One kilo of egg production emits more CO2 than one kilo of chicken production and one egg contains a cholesterol equivalent of three Big Macs. Should this not be reason enough to completely disrupt this cruel industry, in developing nations such as India, antibiotics are routinely used in poultry farms as a substitute for sanitation which is giving rise to the biggest health emergency of the world: antibiotic resistance. Evo Foods was founded in 2019 by Kartik Dixit and Shraddha Bhansali, on a mission to disrupt and revolutionize the poultry egg industry using their proprietary patent-pending technology and local Indian ingredients such as mung beans and peas. Evo Foods says it is one of the few companies in the world which has reached price parity with multiple animal egg categories across geographies. “In the US currently the average price of plant-based eggs is 184% higher than the price of animal-based eggs. This is where EVO can capitalize on the demand by providing high quality and affordable plant-based eggs,” said Co-founder Bhansali. Evo is aiming to launch via food service and has already partnered with multiple restaurants across India to launch it as a part of their menu in the second quarter. The company is also in discussions with multiple big QSR chains for a massive launch by the end of this year and plans to launch in overseas markets by 2022. This year, the company received PETA India’s most innovative company award. The majority of the funds will be used for the Indian market launch, building the R&D and marketing team and expanding in the category to prepare for overseas launch in 2022. Kartik Dixit said of the news: “I started Evo Foods when I was 24 with the sole vision of creating an animal-agriculture free world by the time I reach 40. We aim to leverage the immense crop biodiversity of India, an amazing talent pool and state of the art research and technology to completely remove animals out of the food chain by offering consumers nutritious, delicious, affordable and sustainable alternatives. Evo is an embodiment of the role India is going to play in the global alternative protein sector. In a couple of years, we want to see Evo from a local Kirana shop in Pauni, a small town in India where I am originally from, to a Michelin starred restaurant in New York City. We are absolutely thrilled to have received support from such a stellar group of believers and investors.” Ryan Bethencourt of Sustainable Food Ventures commented: “I had put a personal cheque before in Evo and we are glad to fuel this passionate team again through Sustainable Food Ventures as they launch and create the largest clean protein company of India and consequently the world!”    "
9737,"Invest Denmark: “With More Than Half of all Danes Planning to Cut Down Meat Consumption, Denmark is the Perfect Choice for Developing & Testing New Products”",https://vegconomist.com/interviews/irma-denmark-with-more-than-half-of-all-danes-planning-to-cut-down-meat-consumption-denmark-is-the-perfect-choice-for-developing-testing-new-products/,2021-04-16,"Danish Supermarket Irma states that “not since the breakthrough of ecology has a commodity group grown as fast as plant-based food is doing right now,” with figures showing that plantbased sales increased by 31 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. This year, the chain expects growth of 50 percent.  Sales are now so high that Irma has created a special product group it calls KlimaMad. The chain has partnered with organic producer Hanegal, which has rethought a number of classic dishes, in a green version. The range is called Jordnær and is plant-based organic dishes made from ingredients that are in season and grown locally. In Irma’s “Green Meal” department, the selection has increased fourfold to over 200 different products. Interest in plant-based products is highest on Irma’s home turf, Copenhagen, and the chain has a share of these products that is three times higher than the national average. We spoke with Katrine Dalsgaard Skovly, Special Advisor, Food & Agriculture at Invest Denmark, about these interesting developments. What are the priorities?
Denmark is known around the globe for bacon and butter, and “Made in Denmark” is a brand of safe and high quality food. Danish food production is one of the most sustainable and efficient in the world and Danish food producers have taken on the challenge of feeding the growing global population with new plant-based food products to complement existing products. Denmark has adopted a holistic or circular approach to the development of the new plant-based segments and promotes collaboration throughout the entire value chain – from farm to fork. When working with plant-based alternatives to traditional products, the Danish industry has not taken the approach of imitating or mimicking original products but rather an approach of creating alternatives. i.e products that can be used in the same manner and for the same purpose as the original but do not necessarily look, taste and feel identical. The focus is on creating healthy and natural products of high quality and with great taste while caring for the environment. The emerging Danish plant-based food industry is primarily based on: Sustainability: Denmark is known as the State of Green, and accelerating the green transition is a top priority for the Danish government as well as the industry. To the food industry, achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals and fighting climate changes is an integral part of all innovation and product development. Danish plant-based food companies take on the challenge of being sustainable by a variety of different means; energy-efficient production, local sourcing, valorisation of side streams, organic ingredients, fighting food waste and reusable or biodegradable packaging.      Health: Danish food and ingredients companies invest heavily in research, development and new production methods to produce healthy alternatives to standard foods that do not fail on sensory quality. Reformulation is high on the agenda with a focus on ingredients that can reduce the amount of e.g. added sugar, salt and fat in food products as well as include locally sourced and high-quality plant-based proteins. What initiatives are there in Denmark to promote the plant-based economy?
Across the entire industry, several iniatives have been taken – of which these are a few of the most recent: “It is our mission to support the growth in the Danish food cluster through innovation, collaboration and entrepreneurship. The new plant-based alliance is centered around paving the way for companies looking to work with development and commercialization of the food of the future. With this alliance we wish to provide a strong and relevant forum for all stakeholders wishing to be a part of the plant-based community in Denmark,” says Lars Visbech Sørensen, CEO of Food & Bio Cluster Denmark How do you estimate the development of the plant-based sector in Denmark in the next five years?
With a growing global population and an increased focus on sustainability and climate changes, the need for plant-based food is going to grow year by year. Danish companies will be well-positioned to respond to the demand for healthy, sustainable, natural, safe, affordable and convenient food products because of the Danish industry‘s innovation power, world-class research, collaboration across the value chaing and efficient production methods. Emphasis will continue to be on healthy food while sustainable ingredients and production methods is a must. The Danish consumers are increasingly demanding more and better plant-based food and with more than half of all Danes planning to cut down their meat consumption to eat more vegetables and plant-based alternatives, Denmark is the perfect choice for developing and testing new products. What is the importance of the plant-based sector for exports?
Denmark produces three times as much food as the country consumes and 75% of the food produced in Denmark is exported to other countries. Export of food products amount to about 25% of the total Danish export which illustrates the size of the food industry and its importance to Denmark. Launch of new plant-based products is booming in Denmark and several Danish plant-based brands are already selling outside of Denmark. With the expected growth in the demand for and supply of plant-based food, the plant-based food production will have a positive impact on Danish export. Are there also initiatives in Denmark to promote the cultivated meat/cheese/milk/egg sector?
A new network for cultured meat has been created on the initiative of the Department of Food Science at Aarhus University, AU FOOD. The network will accelerate the development of cultured meat based on local, Nordic ingredients as a sustainable alternative on the market: AU FOOD accelerates the development of cultured meat within the framework of a new Nordic network    "

Singcell will evaluate and license the plant-based edible microcarriers technology developed by the university, with the aim of solving the cost and scalability issues in the cultured meat industry. The startup was founded to help cultured meat companies manufacture their products and scale their operations in the Asian market. “This [microcarriers] technology is very complementary to SingCell’s existing 3D cell culture technology, and soon we will be able to offer a more comprehensive bioprocessing scale-up solution to our clients,” said Karolis Rosickas, CEO of SingCell. Last year, Singcell pitched its technology at the Asia-Pacific Agri-Food Innovation Summit with eleven other groundbreaking startups. It is a portfolio company of Eat Beyond Holdings, a Canadian investment issuer focused on the global plant-based and alternative food sector. In a recent interview with vegconomist, Eat Beyond said it was looking for companies “developing sustainable, healthy and innovative food products with a focus on plant-based foods and other innovations.” “SingCell is focused on improving the feasibility of the cultured meat industry by focusing purely on the cost and scalability of the technology,” said Eat Beyond CEO Patrick Morris. “The company is also located in Singapore, which is truly the epicenter of this industry and was the first jurisdiction globally to approve cell-based meat for consumption.”    "
9774,Opinion: Large Multinationals Are Conquering the Vegan Market. Good Thing or Bad Thing?,https://vegconomist.com/society/opinion-large-multinationals-are-conquering-the-vegan-market-good-thing-or-bad-thing/,2021-04-09,"The list of small, medium, large and huge companies that are expanding their categories to include vegan products continues to grow overwhelmingly. From the corner shop to Burger King to Unilever, plant-based capitalism without a doubt is booming on an international level. Many indicators point to a tipping point that will permanently transform the global market.  Between 2010 and 2020, companies producing alternative products to animal-based products raised almost $6 billion, of which more than half was raised in 2020 alone. A recent study from Blue Horizon and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) revealed that peak meat production will be reached in Europe and North America in 2025, and will begin to decline thereafter, increasingly replaced by alternative proteins. However, the current entry of some companies into this market has generated a certain level of mistrust in some sectors of the consuming public, partly as a result of their human rights records, among other factors. This is particularly noticeable in large multinationals whose supply chains are extensive and complex. At the same time, it has also caused controversy – especially among the vegan community – that many of them continue to profit, in large part, from the sale of animal products. Addressing this issue, vegconomist en español spoke to four experts from the worlds of vegan entrepreneurship, NGOs, academia, and activism, to get their take on the issue. Cristina Rodrigo, Country Manager ProVeg International in Spain: Our mission is to demand better food systems that are more sustainable, resilient and functional. And it will be impossible to achieve this without asking companies and organisations to review and improve their approach. If we want to see large-scale transformation, we need to bring companies like Nestlé and Unilever into this change, regardless of their history. When brands and multinationals make positive changes, such as embracing a greener future, we can only applaud their efforts and hope that this will encourage more companies to adapt and progress. It is vital and urgent that they do so. Maria Troya, Research Fellow at the Good Food Institute (GFI) and MBA with a focus on Sustainability, Food and Agriculture from Oxford University: The entry of large corporations into the vegan market is undoubtedly a positive and essential step in driving the transition towards greater consumption of plant-based products. This will be essential for the vegan industry to become more competitive. Getting more corporate participation in this market, especially from companies that have historically had a large supply of animal products, is key to achieving the goals that the vegan movement has around this food transition. We can expect that the entry of corporations into the vegan market will: 1) result in an increase in the supply of plant-based products, many of them at a lower cost, 2) expand consumer access to a wider variety of vegan products, and 3) in some cases, lead to corporations replacing their animal product portfolio with plant-based products. Additionally, we must consider that there are financial, operational and technological barriers that limit the growth of the vegan and alternative protein industry. Investment by corporations can be key to overcoming these. In particular, it could result in the development of new value chains and infrastructure, attract greater investment, and drive entrepreneurship and innovation. All of which will be essential for the vegan industry to become more competitive and highlight the inefficiencies that exist in animal-derived production systems. Paula González Carracedo, founder and CEO of The Vegan Agency, a communication and visibility company for vegan brands, vegan activist and director of the NGO Million Dollar Vegan in Spain: My opinion is totally divided between heart and head. The pragmatic part tells me that it is good news that the same companies responsible for the decline of the planet and the death of so many millions of animals are taking steps towards veganism and a better world for all. “Only time and the long-term end result will tell.” This can be very positive in terms of bringing vegan foods closer to the consumer groups and helping to democratise their reach, making the consumer’s purchase ticket cheaper. However, I am very concerned about the type of food quality they develop, and that they do not make changes at other levels in the same companies (mainly labour inequalities and environmental problems). As an entrepreneur with a still small communication agency, I personally always try to prioritise other vegan businesses in my shopping basket over these large multinationals. So, is it positive? It depends, only time and the final result in the long run will tell. Mariana Issa, Food Innovation Manager at EligeVeg in Mexico, a site managed by Mercy for Animals: Large food companies have huge production facilities, worldwide distribution and relationships with large supermarkets and restaurant chains, so they will be able to offer more plant-based options at lower prices. This is a crucial point in making plant-based food accessible to all. These factors make vegan food more widely available, and thus, when this trend reaches greater penetration in the Latin American market, it will be more affordable for consumers of all socio-economic levels. This is a crucial point in making plant-based food accessible to all. There is no need to choose between supporting large or small companies. We must support both startups and restaurants whose owners are vegan, as well as large food companies that create and sell new plant-based foods. Animals need both approaches: big companies joining the trend, and revolutionary pioneers who strive every day to protect animals and the planet. Let’s remember that most food companies are not yet vegan, so we cannot ignore them and wait for them to change on their own. They should be encouraged and supported. By buying their new plant-based products, we are telling them that we want more vegan products – it’s a way of voting with our money.    "
9776,Moolec Science Expands Portfolio in Mission to “Address Dependency of Animal Proteins in Every Segment of the Food Industry”,https://vegconomist.com/science/moolec-science-expands-portfolio-in-mission-to-address-dependency-of-animal-proteins-in-every-segment-of-the-food-industry/,2021-04-09,"Moolec Science, a global Ag-Foodtech company based in the UK whose purpose is improving the affordability of animal-free food solutions, presents its latest two developments which join its working portfolio of meat analogs made with blends of soybean with selected porcine proteins and pea with bovine proteins.  Moolec’s hybrid approach to plant and cell-based production technologies for alternative proteins is known as Molecular Farming. Through this approach, the company has produced new functionalizing oat concentrates with co-expressed whey protein. Additionally, ovum protein is being engineered into wheat for an egg replacement specially designed for the bakery industry. “We started exploring the space more than 10 years ago. We were the first team to fully deregulate a Molecular Farming crop and its functionalized protein concentrate for its use in the cheese-making industry, a product that has been successfully used in the manufacturing of thousands of tons of soft and hard cheeses. Since then, we expanded to animal-free meat ingredients and are now announcing a broadening of our pipeline into dairy and egg replacements,” says Gastón Paladini, CEO & CO-Founder. “Proteins are responsible for the functionality, mouth experience and many nutritional aspects in food. The greatest food experiences are mostly those which include high-quality products. And top products only use the best ingredients. We want to collaborate with B2C food companies to offer the optimal journey and proper affordability for consumers by using our integral animal-free solutions.” “Our selection of dairy and egg proteins will be produced in the host crop. We are going to let the plants, the sun and the land work and, after only basic processing, Moolec’s product will have superior nutritional and functional properties for a fraction of the cost. For example, our wheat and egg protein products will have a higher content of digestible protein and, thus, improved nutritional value,” states Henk Hoogenkamp, CPO & Co-Founder.    "
9781,New Food Conference 2021: “The Pandemic Accelerated the Plant-Based Trend – Now It’s About Using the Momentum For Innovation”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/new-food-conference-2021-the-pandemic-accelerated-the-plant-based-trend-now-its-about-using-the-momentum-for-innovation/,2021-04-08,"Both disruptive protein technology and the market for sustainable food solutions are growing at a mind-blowing pace. The New Food Conference is Europe’s first and biggest conference on new-protein solutions and a key event for food-industry stakeholders. Katleen Haefele, International Head of Food Services and Events at ProVeg, talks to vegconomist about what to expect at this year’s online event.  What is unique about this year’s New Food Conference and how does it differ from the debut event in 2019?
In 2019, we still had to convince people that alternative proteins were going to play a significant role in future market activities. Today, with plant-based sales skyrocketing, it is no longer a question of whether eating habits are changing, but how and how fast. In responding to the shift in perspective in the food industry, we decided to host two New Food Conferences this year so that we can go more in-depth with the topics: the April event is predominantly focussed on developments in the plant-based market, while the New Food Conference at Anuga, in October 2021, will have a stronger emphasis on cellular agriculture and fermentation technologies. The New Food Conference in April will be a completely online experience, allowing us to reach a far wider audience and will also allow participants to connect more internationally. Given this new online format, how do you plan to enable professional networking?
Networking is at the heart of the New Food Conference and a lot of careful consideration has been put into setting up this year’s virtual edition in order to ensure effective engagement, interaction, and professional networking. It will be implemented via a state-of-the-art event platform with multiple technical features: Delegates can set up their profile and reach out to each other to request appointments for video calls. A personalised event agenda allows participants to see their favourite programme sessions and networking appointments at a glance. At the exhibitors’ virtual booths, delegates can reach out to chat with experts, as well as some of the most promising alternative-protein startups. Q&As and chat functions during the sessions will allow participants to actively shape the conversation. All sessions will be recorded and will be available for 90 days after the event, providing maximum flexibility for all those busy people in the food industry. What are this year’s programme highlights?
We are excited to have Josh Tetrick from Eat Just join us in a fireside chat. Not only is JUST Egg the fastest growing egg alternative in the US. It was also the first company in the world to gain regulatory approval for cultured meat – in Singapore in December 2020 – shortly after which they started serving cultured meat in a restaurant for the first time ever! We will also focus on the regulatory framework in Europe and how it does and does not support plant-based innovation. One conversation will be about the EU’s Farm-to-fork strategy and its implications for businesses, while another will focus on the role of labelling, including a look at the outcome of the decision on Amendment 171. Additionally, the programme will cover developments in the food-service sector and advancements in functional ingredients, as well as sharing market data and looking at the criteria for retail placements of plant-based products. The goal is to explore the entire value chain and identify bottlenecks and opportunities for plant-based products. The New Food Conference is the platform for alternative protein experts. What are the current challenges in the value chain?
Up-scaling and co-manufacturing are still challenging. Producers need to ensure reliable ingredient supply chains and, at the same time, have access to new production lines. Retailers are still the market’s ‘bouncers’ and decide which products will eventually find their way to consumers. As a result, we expect more companies to market D2C (“direct to consumer”) in order to bypass this bottleneck – a trend that small brands and startups in particular will make more use of in the future. The HoReCa sector is probably facing one of the biggest challenges. Having been hit hard by the pandemic, only time will tell who will survive this shock moment. One thing’s for sure, though: the pandemic has accelerated the plant-based trend. Now, it’s about using this momentum to create new concepts in order to get food services back on track. The event encourages conversation and discussion. Which topics will be new?
Agriculture – where the value chain actually begins – has not yet received the attention it deserves. It’s crucial to initiate a dialog with farmers on how to transform agriculture in a sustainable way, not only away from animal husbandry and towards protein plants for human consumption, but also with resilient crops and soil regeneration in mind. We need to look at how businesses and farmers can work together in a way that allows experimentation with new crops, without risking supply chain gaps? We will also discuss the status quo of cellular agriculture: Where are cultured products when it comes to commercialisation – can we expect to see them on our plates any time soon? Who should attend the New Food Conference?
Alternative proteins will continue to increase in significance for the food industry. Companies keep realising that this is where we are all headed and acknowledge that it is time to join in. They often wonder how they can increase their own protein portfolio – and this is what the New Food Conference is here to help with. We aim to be a platform of professional exchange for players from all along the food value chain, whether it’s startups, producers, retailers, or food-service stakeholders. We expect an international audience to attend, with the majority joining from Europe. Additionally, we invite politicians to learn more about alternative proteins and their role in future-proofing companies – so that they can get a better understanding of how political and legal structures need to align with this transformation of the food industry.

High profile investors in this round included Lever VC; Gullspang Re:Food (Oatly); Humboldt Fund (NotCo & Geltor); David Yeung’s Green Monday Ventures (Beyond Meat & Perfect Day); Enfini Ventures (Impossible Foods & Memphis Meats); and an undisclosed European meat company. The company is focused on cultivating animal fat without the animal; in July of 2020 Mission Barns contacted vegconomist to inform us that it had developed the world’s first cultivated bacon. The team works to create products incorporating Mission Fat both independently and through collaborations with leading meat companies and plant protein partners. Products include bacon, breakfast patties, burgers, nuggets, dumplings, hot dogs, poultry sausages, and meatballs.  Consumers repeatedly cite flavor, mouthfeel, and meatiness as the leading hurdles to regularly purchasing plant-based meat products. CEO Eitan Fischer said: “Time and again, we see that the addition of Mission Fat to plant proteins makes alternative meat products in any number of categories far outperform the incumbent plant-based options.” Mission Barns is partnering with leading meat and alternative protein companies globally, and is open to further partnership opportunities to utilize its Mission Fat technology.

9788,Study Finds Interest and Support For Veganism is Skyrocketing in Belgium,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/study-finds-interest-and-support-for-veganism-is-skyrocketing-in-belgium/,2021-04-07,"As Dunkin this week announces over 40 vegan donuts to its Belgian menus, new research from psychologists at the University of Bath reveals an increasing number of people in Belgium are shunning meat in favour of plant-based alternatives. The survey found that the proportion of people who were satisfied with meat alternatives grew significantly from 44% in 2019 to 51% in 2020.   The University of Bath study on the growing popularity of meat alternatives was carried out with two large surveys of 1,000 people in Belgium, in collaboration with Belgian animal welfare organisation GAIA. The reflection of rapidly changing Belgian attitudes to meat-free diets is backed up by supermarkets such as Lidl recently adding 11 new products to its vegan range in the country. Belgium was also the chosen location for Plenitude, the world’s first large scale mycoprotein plant which is scheduled to open this year in Ghent, following its securing last year of €17m in funding. In the data, concerns around animal agriculture and the environment that are impacting individuals’ dietary choices were highlighted. Additional findings suggest there has been no significant change in attitudes towards cell-cultured meat over the two years, with 40% of Belgians saying they would buy cell-cultured meat. Interestingly, plant-based alternatives were more appealing to women, while cultured meat was more appealing to men.  “In many ways, this survey data confirms what many of us can see in the supermarkets: plant-based alternatives to meat and animal products are on the rise. In just one year, we saw a significant increase in the number of Belgian consumers satisfied with plant-based alternatives with the key figure moving to just over half in 2020,” explains lead researcher Dr Chris Bryant from the University of Bath’s Department of Psychology.

The dairy and meat giant has become increasingly proactive in its plant-based output, with the launch of Richmond’s meat-free mince and meatballs the latest offerings announced this week.  Richmond first launched its first meat-free product last year with its plant-based sausages and since then a burger has also been added to the now expanded range. Kerry Group was ranked #5 on the FAIRR list of global companies actively supporting plant-based foods and beverages, recently acquiring Dutch maker of textured meat alternatives Ojah, as well as Pevesa Biotech, a Spanish specialist in non-allergenic and organic plant proteins.  With a new report revealing the rapid acceleration of the alternative protein market, Kerry Group looks set to be riding the wave of a market said to reach at least $290 billion by 2035, a figure higher than the GDP of Finland. “We know the meat-free market is booming but we’re seeing a real opportunity for growth in shoppers who are looking for affordable, delicious meat-free food to slot into family favourites – that they know will result in clean plates all round. We’ve been blown away by the success of our Richmond Meat-Free range so far and are using this momentum to help retailers offer even more choice at mealtimes and recruit new shoppers to the meat-free category,” Kerry Foods marketing and category director Victoria Southern told The Grocer.

9852,Experts Reveal That “Peak Meat” Will Be Reached in Europe and North America By 2025,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/experts-reveal-that-peak-meat-will-be-reached-in-europe-and-north-america-by-2025/,2021-03-23,"The tipping point has almost arrived. Following news that 2020 saw a record $3.1 billion capital investment in alt protein, a first-of-its-kind report has been released this evening which suggests that Europe and North America could reach “peak meat” by 2025, from when the consumption of animal protein will be in decline. By 2035, just a decade later, it predicts that every tenth portion of food eaten globally will be made from alt proteins.  The report, published by Blue Horizon and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) – titled Food for Thought: The Protein Transformation – reveals the rapid acceleration of the meat, egg, dairy and seafood alternative market, and finds that the market could reach $290 billion by 2035, which is more than the GDP of Finland. In the report’s base case scenario the alt protein market will grow from the current 13 million metric tons a year to 97 million metric tons when it will make up 11% of the overall protein market. Though the report also calculates that with faster technological innovation and full regulatory support that speed of growth could reach a more ambitious 22% of the overall market.  As consumers drive unparalleled growth in plant-based and cell-cultured alternatives, the adoption of alternative proteins will have a measurable positive impact on the environment, says the report. The shift to plant-based meat and eggs alone will save more than 1 gigaton of CO2 equivalent by 2035, which is the equivalent of a country like Japan becoming carbon-neutral for an entire year. It will also save 39 billion cubic meters of water, enough to supply the city of London for 40 years.  Benjamin Morach, a BCG managing director and partner, said, “Alternative proteins could soon match animal protein in taste, texture, and price. We expect parity to spur a new wave of growth, catapulting what is a fairly nascent market today into the mainstream, yielding significant environmental benefits, and facilitating even faster growth.”     "

Meatable finalized its first showcase product in 2020 and aims to use the new funds to advance small-scale production at the Biotech Campus Delft and to diversify its product portfolio. The consortium consists of Dr. Rick Klausner, Section 32, Dr. Jeffrey Leiden, and DSM Venturing, and includes existing investors, such as BlueYard Capital, Agronomics, Humboldt, and Taavet Hinrikus, showing continued support. Dr. Rick Klausner, former director of the US National Cancer Institute and former Executive Director of Global Health at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, sees great potential in Meatable and its technology. “We are committed to joining Meatable in its mission to address the world’s most pressing challenges. We see a smart start-up that has accomplished a lot in a short amount of time. They have a great team and game-changing technology that can address the challenges around the global food insecurity issues our planet is facing,” said Klausner. “They have all the right ingredients to become the leading choice for sustainably and efficiently produced meat.” Meatable’s proprietary platform technology enables a fundamentally more cost effective and scalable production process. It replicates the natural process of fat and muscle growth, in proportions that emulate traditional cuts of meat. The entire process, when fully developed, is expected to take only weeks to produce meat, whereas it takes years to grow a live animal. “To be able to meet the growing demand for meat worldwide, we need breakthrough solutions. Cultivated meat has the potential to continue to produce the product we love – meat – using a much more efficient production process. Having Rick Klausner, Jeffrey Leiden, Section 32 and DSM Venturing support us in realizing that potential is a huge step for Meatable,” said Krijn de Nood, CEO and co-founder of Meatable. “We are honored to welcome a like-minded group of investors who support us on our mission – to develop, accelerate and bring to life sustainable, healthy and environmentally sound technologies that can improve the human condition. With this funding we believe we are well on our way to bringing our first products to market to sustainably satisfy the world’s appetite for meat.” Meatable aims, as they claim, to produce cultivated meat, for which no animals are slaughtered, fewer GHG emissions are released, and significantly less land and water are required. And, unlike plant-based alternatives, the end-product will provide the full experience of eating actual meat, with the same texture, taste, and nutritional benefits. After successfully completing its first pork showcase product, Meatable is currently focused on the further development of cultivated pork and beef. Meatable’s technology is adaptable to any cell-based species, including cows, pigs, sheep, and fish, giving the company great opportunity for further product development.    "

9881,"Alt Proteins Received Record $3.1 Billion Capital Invested in 2020, 3X More Than 2019",https://vegconomist.com/investments/alt-proteins-received-record-3-1-billion-capital-invested-in-2020-3x-more-than-2019/,2021-03-18,"As the social, environmental, and economic changes taking place in the wake of the global pandemic continue to take effect, new data revealed by the GFI today highlights 2020 as a “record period of investment” in companies producing alt protein. Companies producing alternatives to animal products raised almost $6 billion in the past decade (2010–2020), over half of which was raised in 2020 alone.  The report states that global alternative protein companies received $3.1 billion in disclosed investments in 2020, which is more than three times as much as the $1 billion raised in 2019 and four and a half times as much as the $694 million raised in 2018. The GFI describes that the insight offered by these astonishing numbers reflect that the “prospect of meat produced with zero risk of contributing to zoonotic disease transmission or antibiotic resistance has even greater relevance,” and that investors are increasingly acknowledging that, since climate risk is investment risk, “alternative proteins offer a scalable solution that gets the world closer to a more secure, carbon-neutral food system.” Received $2.1 billion in investments in 2020 — the most capital raised in any single year in the industry’s history and more than three times the $667 million raised in 2019. Plant-based meat, egg, and dairy companies have raised $4.4 billion in investments in the past decade (2010–2020). Nearly half, or $2.1 billion, was raised in 2020 alone. This included Impossible Foods’ record $700 million funding haul, which comprised a $500 million Series F in March and a $200 million Series G in August; Oatly’s $200 million private equity and $78 million debt financing; and Califia Farms’ $172 million private equity financing.  Received more than $360 million in investments in 2020, which is six times the amount raised in 2019 and 72 percent of the amount raised in the industry’s history (2016–2020). This included the first two series B raises in the segment: Memphis Meats’ landmark $186 million round and Mosa Meat’s $75 million round. Companies in the world of alternative proteins received $590 million in investments in 2020, which is more than double the amount raised in 2019. This included Perfect Day’s $300 million Series C funding round and Nature’s Fynd’s $45 million debt round—the first disclosed venture debt capital raise by a fermentation company. Fermentation companies have raised more than $1 billion in investments since the first GFI-tracked investment in 2013, 57 percent of which was raised in 2020 alone. GFI Senior Investor Engagement Specialist Sharyn Murray: “The investor community is waking up to the massive social and economic potential of food technology to radically remake our food system. Early trendsetters like Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat, Memphis Meats, and Mosa Meat continue to perform well, and there are more and more entrepreneurs who see the potential of alternative proteins to succeed in the marketplace while having a positive global impact on food sustainability and global health.” GFI Director of Corporate Engagement Caroline Bushnell: “2020 was a breakout year for alternative proteins, with record investment flowing into all segments of the industry. This is yet another signal of the significant potential the private sector sees in this rapidly growing global industry. While the amount is record-breaking, more investment is needed—from both the public and the private sectors—to meet the urgency of this moment. A large-scale shift toward alternative proteins will be critical to mitigating the environmental impact of food production, meeting the Paris Climate Agreement, and sustainably feeding a growing global population.” For deeper insights on the state of alternative proteins, keep an eye out for GFI’s State of the Industry reports, which will be published in May.

9888,Just Vegan Dubai Restaurant Chain Set for Expansion as Plant-Based Takes off In Middle East,https://vegconomist.com/gastronomy-and-catering/just-vegan-dubai-restaurant-chain-set-for-expansion-as-plant-based-takes-off-in-middle-east/,2021-03-17,"Just Vegan, one of the most popular plant-based restaurants in Dubai, is to expand with the opening of five more stores. The significant expansion project reflects the rise in popularity and awareness of plant-based food across the region, with the UAE becoming a new hub for plant-based business.  The Just Vegan healthy concept restaurants are currently located in Dubai Marina and in Al Seef, and there will be new casual dining outlets opening in Al Quoz, Business Bay, Barsha, and City Walk, as well as a fine-dining restaurant in Jumeirah before the end of April 2021. The Just Vegan website states that its “founders have successful ventures around the globe, spanning from the Middle East, USA, UK, South East Asia,” and that its HQ is New York. As we reported recently, Dubai’s plant-based market has taken off during the Covid-19 pandemic and shows no signs of stopping. As a result, the UAE is increasingly attractive to foreign companies, with Spinneys, one of the UAE’s biggest supermarkets, now stocking major plant-based brands, and Heather Mills’ VBites revealing plans to move further into the region.  In an interview with vegconomist yesterday, Saudi Prince Khaled bin Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud commented: “Gulf countries, specifically Saudi and the UAE, have been thinking of sustainable food production, alternative proteins, and more for years. It just isn’t as highly publicized as programs in the EU or North America.” Nathalia Tomacheusqui Durbano, manager at Just Vegan, told Caterer Middle East: “With its wider expansion across the town, Just Vegan restaurant brand aims at making vegan food widely accessible to a larger audience – both vegan and also non-vegans, looking to explore dietary options.”    "
9889,Brazil: Fast-Growing Vegan Brand The New Butchers Announces Lever VC Investment,https://vegconomist.com/investments/brazil-fast-growing-vegan-brand-the-new-butchers-announces-lever-vc-investment/,2021-03-17,"The New Butchers is among the fastest growing brands in Latin America; in its first 18 months of operation the brand has grown to more than 700 outlets, including Brazil‘s two largest retail chains, Pao de Acucar and CarreFour. This week the brand announces it will be funded by Lever VC, one of the largest investors in the alternative protein space.  The New Butchers, launched in 2019 by triathlete and vegan entrepreneur Bruno Fonseca, will also receive financial backing from Paulo Veras, founder and CEO of 99, Brazil’s first tech unicorn. The funds will be used to complete the expansion of a 1,000 square meter production facility in response to demand for the company’s products from Brazilian retailers. Its new product line consists of The New Chicken 2.0™, a pea protein-based product that is reportedly the first plant-based chicken fillet in the Brazilian market; The New Burger™, a classic beef-style burger made with pea protein that in consumer taste tests has consistently outranked all competitors in Brazil; The New Fish™, the first salmon derived from peas along with natural paprika extract, and rich in omega 3; as well as newcomers cod fillet and cod dumplings, based on a pea protein and jackfruit mix that is said to mimic the fibers of fish meat. “Since 2017 we have been researching and developing our products with the goal of offering something more delicious and cleaner than everything else in the Brazilian market today,” said Bruno Fonseca, CEO and founder of The New. “For example, we do not use hydrogenated palm fat, choosing instead to use natural coconut fat, which when combined with pea protein has an incredible flavor.”    "
9890,Vegconomist in Conversation With Prince Khaled bin Alwaleed,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/vegconomist-in-conversation-with-prince-khaled-bin-alwaleed/,2021-03-16,"HRH Prince Khaled bin Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of KBW Ventures and the Founding Chairman of KBW Investments, which has funded extensively in the area of alternative proteins through a portfolio that includes several vegconomist favourites such as Rebellyous Foods, Turtle Tree Labs, Matthew Kenney, BlueNalu, Memphis Meats, Moku Foods, and Bond Pet Foods.   Firstly, it would be fascinating for our readers to know a little more about your vegan journey and your path into the plant-based business world.
The two things are intrinsically linked. When I started eating healthier, learning more about the food chain, production, the social ills that come with what is modern animal agriculture matched with the overall disregard for the environment – it all culminated in the need to get involved at a deeper level. I started small, like anyone else – voting with my wallet and being vocal about the lack of options in restaurants, in hotels, on flights, and everywhere else. That does work by the way – the asking for options makes its way up and eventually they start to cater to that recurring request – we’re now seeing the results of that with all of the fast-food chains picking up plant-based options. It’s a great thing! Once I committed to a vegan lifestyle and was constantly shocked by the lack of vegan options, I knew that the clean meat and plant-based business models would be big. It was so clear that there was a massive market just waiting to be serviced, and they would be loyal customers and brand advocates. I remember sitting down at one of the more popular places on the waterfront in San Francisco; every table completely full with people having brunch. At this time, I had already started investing in alternative proteins and looking for investments around sustainable solutions. The Impossible Burger was on the menu for $4 more than the beef burger, and there was one being eaten on every second table. It’s true that Silicon Valley isn’t a good benchmark for society as a whole, but it was a watershed moment for me to see food tech broadly adopted even though the price match wasn’t there yet. Fast forward to the present day, we are celebrating leaps forward in food tech and now, this landmark regulatory approval in Singapore. For a few years now I have voted with my investments; it’s a really good feeling seeing these businesses flourish. As founder and CEO of KBW Ventures you invest in a varied and extensive portfolio – what business characteristics does KBW look for in a company?
The first thing is always who the people are running the show. What is the founding team like? Do they have a passion to make this work for the long haul? I always look for potential to scale. Can this product or service get big? Really big? Where do they see the business going? What are the verticals? What’s the competition like? What is your product or service doing differently than the next best company? Do you have a long- and short-term roadmap? Some of our portfolio companies are also impact investments, and having that social good element is always welcomed of course. KBW has invested in numerous cellular agriculture start-ups such as Blue Nalu and TurtleTree Labs. How far away do you think the world is from cell-based foods going mainstream?
It depends on how you look at things. Based on the leaps forward made just in the past two years, I consider that we aren’t far at all. We’re seeing cultured chicken for sale in Singapore, and Blue Nalu intends to take its aqua-cultured mahi to market by the end of the year. If I would have said that these companies would have commercialized by 2021, 99% of people I know would have laughed that off. So, are we far away? No, not at all. Public perception is going to count for a lot here. There are too many people out there having grandiose debates about whether or not to support the new McPlant burger or the vegan Kit-Kat. Don’t buy if you don’t like the corporate methodology, but for the flexitarian population these breakthrough products are the perfect alternatives to eating animal products. Think big picture results! KBW also has numerous plant-based startups among its portfolio, including Moku and Rebellyous. In your experience, what are the biggest challenges plant-based businesses face in today’s world?
Marketing and PR. The biggest challenge before was gaining mainstream acceptance, and convincing the big players that there was a market for high-quality plant-based foods. Now, it is perfectly normal for non-vegans to have a number of vegan products in their fridge/freezer for Meatless Mondays and so on. I think point of sale is still a challenge for some brands as well as you need advantageous positioning in the grocery store to get seen and bought. Both Moku and Rebellyous are available online now, which is great for reach and accessibility. Moku is seeing terrific sales numbers; all things compared, Moku jerky is a better snack food, great tasting, rich in texture, and saves a ton of natural resources. Matt [Feldman] was really keen on keeping Moku’s products natural in terms of ingredients, and the jerky is really versatile. It works on salads, on Beyond Burgers as a rich top-up, and I’m eating it as day-to-day snack. Moku was recently chosen for Amazon’s Emerging Brands program which definitely is a boon sales-wise. With Rebellyous, they began with a B2B focus – placing their plant-based chicken nuggets on school menus – and quickly pivoted during the pandemic. Now, they have patties, strips and nuggets that go direct to consumer with their products for sale on GTFO It’s Vegan. How do you think governments in the Middle East will play a role in a plant-based and sustainable future?
Governments in the GCC already are; there are government incubators, competitions, and more, all around food tech and agtech. At NEOM, Saudi’s most ambitious project to date, there is a Future of Food Sector. During the 2020 Entrepreneurship World Cup held by Saudi Arabia’s Misk, the winner of the significant cash prize was a cellag company: TurtleTree Labs. The year before, an agtech company from Saudi ranked in the top five also taking home undiluted funding as a prize. In the UAE, there are both agtech and food tech programs run by the Minister of State for Food Security, HE Mariam Almheiri who is fantastically passionate about sustainable solutions. Gulf countries, specifically Saudi and the UAE, have been thinking of sustainable food production, alternative proteins, and more for years. It just isn’t as highly publicized as programs in the EU or North America. As a high-profile vegan activist, how do you think your activism inspires the people of the Middle East?
I mean look, if one person decides to go for a plant-based burger over a factory-farmed one, I’m happy. That’s one more person through the gate. I’ve had a lot of people on social media talk about how they have gone vegan or at the very least they are now flexitarian and filtering animal products out more and more often. I advocate for realistic progress; not crazy ideas that will never happen. I believe that having this discussion rationally and presenting people with options that taste great – not to mention are healthier – will continue to turn the tide. And finally, what predictions do you have for the plant- and cell-based landscape of the future?
I mean I have been talking about big bioreactors that can grow meats sustainably for years, and that sounded really crazy to most people. Now the only thing left to predict is scale, mass adoption, and price point. More of the big players out there are seeing the market shift and reacting by introducing plant-based products or partnering with known brands in the space already. Price points are already becoming more accessible, people are gradually seeing the benefits of plant-based alternatives, and hopefully more are understanding the benefits of cell-based products as well. For plant-based products, I see us working toward better cheeses. Commercially, I see that more of the established companies are going to get into B2B ingredient and material production and supply, again impacting affordability very positively.    "

Elysabeth is the founder of Plant Powered Consulting, the host of the Plantbased Business Hour and the Consulting Managing Director, vegconomist, North America. Here is the Plantbased Business Minute for the week ending March 12, 2021. The wait is over! Plant-based steaks are here! Slovenian company, Juicy Marbles, is now making filet mignon with their special technique of layering fibers such that it mimics muscle texture and fat marbling. In addition, since they control the process, they can bring down the price of these delicacies such that everyone can afford them. My business bottom line here is that 2021 is the year of whole cut meats. Not just filet mignon from Juicy Marbles but, also, you’re going to see steaks come onto the market plus chicken. Maybe even down the road lamb and pork. Speaking of down the road, by 2030 two studies supported by the Good Food Institute indicate that cellular meat will be at price parity with regular meat by 2030. This means that cultivated meat will not only be lower in land usage, lower in water usage and putting out less greenhouse gas emissions, but also it will be at price parity.

Always display content from YouTube My business bottom line here is there is no sane reason that you would ever choose to waste resources like water, land and time when you could have the exact same thing for the same taste and the same price. Oh, the UK how I love you! You remain the epicenter of all things plant-based which is why Oatly is opening its new plant-based milk plant in the UK. It’s set to open in 2023 and Omnipork lands this week in the UK, finally addressing the European need for plant-based pork. My business bottom line here is yes the UK is the epicenter but look for countries like the Netherlands and Germany and basically all of mainstream Europe to follow suit including your friends across the pond. My Linkedin and Clubhouse question for the week is do we have crazy stupid venture money? Is there just so much venture money in the plant-based landscape that it makes no sense?

9902,$2.2 Million Funding Boost For Switzerland’s First Cell-Cultured Firm MIRAI Foods ,https://vegconomist.com/investments/2-2-million-funding-boost-for-switzerlands-first-cell-cultured-firm-mirai-foods/,2021-03-15,"Zurich’s MIRAI Foods, which claims to be the first and only Swiss cell-cultured startup, has today announced an additional USD 2.2 million funding raise in its second financing round. Following the closing of its first round in January, this brings its total seed funding to date to USD 4.5 million.  Founded in 2019, MIRAI sets itself apart by claiming to be one of the very few cell-cultured meat producers globally that does not genetically manipulate its cells. EU consumer tastes and preferences are at the heart of its product development, and it will focus its attention firstly on beef production, as it has the largest greenhouse gas footprint. The company will use the funds to accelerate product development through expanding the team, improving in-house lab capabilities, and building a pilot production plant. MIRAI will move into their new lab and office space this summer. It remains to be seen if MIRAI will pursue the name “Cell-cultured” to describe its forthcoming products, following news that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the term for use.  “With the additional investment, we are in an excellent position to strengthen the team and speed up our research. This investment is critical for our mission to provide delicious, high quality cultivated meat at a fair price. Our partners not only share our mission but also have great strategic and operational capabilities”, says Christoph Mayr, Co-Founder and CEO of MIRAI.     "
9907,"METRO Germany: “For the Wholesale Consumer Market, We Are One of the Pioneers, Especially When it Comes to Alternative Protein”",https://vegconomist.com/interviews/metro-germany-for-the-wholesale-consumer-market-we-are-one-of-the-pioneers-especially-when-it-comes-to-alternative-protein/,2021-03-12,"Markus Thaller is the category manager for sausage & meats at METRO Germany. Despite his proximity to animal meats, he is firmly convinced that alternative proteins will play an increasingly important role in wholesale and for commercial customers – especially against a backdrop of topics like sustainability and climate change.  How many vegan products does METRO Germany currently offer its customers?
At METRO Germany, commercial customers can now find an assortment of well over 1,500 vegan alternatives in all product groups. The focus of the vegan assortment is on the product groups nutrients, frozen foods, dairy products and meats & sausage. In the meat & sausage category, we currently have around 80 vegan alternatives. We are also continuously adding products made from alternative proteins to our METRO own-brand range in the meat & sausage category. Currently, and in the course of the spring, we are releasing a whole range of articles for our customers. How have sales of vegan products at METRO Germany developed in recent years?
We are seeing a significant increase in demand from year to year. More and more people are interested in vegan alternatives, and our customers in the hospitality industry are responding to this trend. The winner of the METRO Award for Sustainable Gastronomy 2020, the Bunte Burger restaurant from Cologne, for example, is relying on a completely vegan concept. And restaurants with more traditional cuisine are now also recognizing that there is a demand and are expanding their menus. For the wholesale market, this makes us one of the pioneers, especially when it comes to alternative protein sources. We recognized this trend early on and were the first German wholesaler to make Beyond Meat products available to our customers. The subsequent hype and the development of the market prove that this is only the beginning. It was therefore logical for us to launch our first own-brand products based on plant-based alternatives under the METRO Chef brand in 2020. At the moment, we are already working on further solutions – always based on current market developments and the needs of our commercial customers. Which product groups are growing particularly?
From our point of view, the target group is becoming broader and broader as the professionalization of products increases. Basically, there is a great interest in everything that makes up the “middle of the plate”. Our customers are therefore primarily looking for a sustainable alternative to meat, which traditionally defines especially German cuisine, but also many other national cuisines. Overall, interest in alternative, sustainable protein sources without animal ingredients is growing across all product groups. In 2018, METRO was one of the first retailers in Germany to launch Beyond Meat items on the German market. How have the products of European producers developed in the last two years?
Products that hit the zeitgeist like this are very rare. In our view, the great success of the Beyond Burger was one of the initial sparks for interest in plant-based alternatives. Since then, many suppliers and partners have caught up: On the one hand, in terms of appearance and palate pleasure, but also in terms of the versatile product range. From our point of view, European producers are extremely innovative and respond flexibly to the needs of our customers and the market. This is, of course, especially true for the brand manufacturers. However, our customers are also asking more and more for high-quality, price-oriented products. We believe that a sustainable alternative must also be affordable. Based on the needs of our customers, we recently launched some of the first purely vegan items of our own brand METRO Chef in METRO wholesale stores across Germany. Others will follow continuously. To start with, these are vegan meat sausage and vegan minced meat, both from the fresh produce department. They are each 100% vegan and without soy. It is important for us to become even more sustainable and to keep the supply chain of the raw materials as short as possible. Therefore, we have chosen a base of sunflower-potato and pea protein for these two products. For us, sustainability also means offering different protein sources so that we can offer our customers a selection of plant-based alternatives from raw materials which are as diversified as possible. How do you expect the growth in the vegan sector to continue to 2025?
We are currently noting a growing interest in plant-based alternatives, which may continue to increase. As already mentioned: with continuously improving products made from different raw materials and a versatile product range at more affordable prices, price-oriented customers can also be addressed with plant-based alternatives. At the same time, the products are also becoming more and more sustainable and thus, in total, more interesting for many consumers. Especially items made from meat scraps may be substituted with plant-based alternatives. In the end, however, the fact remains that people will buy what tastes good – and if it is also sustainable, it will continue to be in high demand. Is METRO planning special promotions for vegan products in the near future (vegan weeks, vegan barbecues, etc., special presentation areas)?
We are also concerned with meeting the growing demand for vegan alternatives in the commercial customer segment, especially in the hospitality industry. That’s why we are currently working on specific solutions for customers in these sectors. They are facing major challenges in the current situation. We focus on ensuring their success. That is the core of our daily work. We are committed to supporting the hospitality and events industry with all our power and offer a wide range of solutions, from digital tools to customized offers and consulting solutions. Of course, METRO particularly offers food as well as non-food assortments. This also includes sustainable packaging materials to optimize restaurant operations for delivery service and out-of-home business. At the same time, we bring our vegan food assortments to the attention by regularly featuring them in our trend flyers and advertising brochures. Especially around the holidays, such as Easter and Christmas, we inspire our customers to try alternative proteins. We are currently testing a variety of new vegan items for our dry food range in several stores and checking how they are perceived by our customers. Of course, we are very much looking forward to the results. Why are vegan products listed in the meat & sausage section at METRO? Isn’t that contradictory?
That is not a contradiction at all. We were convinced early on that even avid meat-eaters are generally interested in alternatives. This perception is reflected in our assortment and placement. Yes, we have a “vegan shelf” in the fresh foods department. But we deliberately place plant-based alternatives near the animal products. By doing so, we are sending a clear signal: no matter which product a METRO customer would like to buy, we have it – and it doesn’t always have to be meat.    "
9909,MeaTech Announces $25 Million US Initial Public Offering & Approval For Nasdaq Listing,https://vegconomist.com/trade/meatech-announces-25-million-us-initial-public-offering-approval-for-nasdaq-listing/,2021-03-12,"MeaTech 3D Ltd., now operating as MeaTech, a technology company focused on developing and out-licensing its proprietary 3D printing technology to manufacture proteins without the need for animal slaughter, today announced the pricing of its previously announced initial public offering of 2,427,185 American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”), each ADS representing 10 of its ordinary shares, at an initial public offering price of $10.30 per ADS, for gross proceeds of approximately $25.0 million.  As we reported in November last year, MeaTech had already been traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange for a year, making it the world’s only public cultivated meat company, and announced it was filing for IPO in the US. That same week the company closed a fundraising round of $7 million. In December, MeaTech fully acquired Peace of Meat, a Belgian producer of cultivated fats, for €15 million in a combination of cash and MeaTech common stock, stating at the time that the company estimates the first hybrid products based on the Peace of Meat cultured fat technology could be on the market as early as 2022. MeaTech has granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 364,077 ADSs at the initial public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. MeaTech ADSs have been approved for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and are expected to begin trading on March 12, 2021 under the ticker symbol “MITC.” H.C. Wainwright & Co. is acting as the sole book-running manager for the offering. All ADSs to be sold in the offering are being offered by MeaTech. The offering is expected to close on or about March 16, 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. MeaTech expects to receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately $21.9 million, or approximately $25.4 million if the underwriter exercises its option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by MeaTech. MeaTech intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to advance its program to develop commercial technologies to manufacture alternative foods, including potential acquisitions of other companies whose technologies are complementary or synergistic to its own, and for general corporate purposes, including working capital requirements.

9911,“Cell-Cultured” as the Newly Accepted Term For Lab-Grown Meat in the USA,https://vegconomist.com/science/cell-cultured-as-the-newly-accepted-term-for-lab-grown-meat-in-the-usa/,2021-03-12,"After some back and forth, it has been tentatively agreed in the USA to call meat from the laboratory “cell-cultured”. This was announced by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after a long exchange with the big players in the clean meat industry.  As early as the end of 2020, the FDA sent out a request to companies that produce cell-based meat or seafood to comment on a possible designation. In the end, BlueNalu, Finless Foods and Memphis Meats, among others, responded to the request.   Among other things, a study by Hallman and Hallman was decisive in the naming. This states that both “cell-cultured” and “cell-based” would inform consumers of essential facts and would not be misleading, as well as presenting the product in a neutral way. Memphis Meats said it supports “disclosure of the term ‘cell-cultured,’ in conjunction with the name of the conventionally-produced seafood product, in the statement of identity or name of cell-cultured seafood products.” The Berkeley, California-based company also noted in its comments that “Terms that specify the type of seafood product (e.g., ‘fillet,’ ‘steak’) should be permitted in the name or statement of identity of a cell-cultured seafood, as long as the term appropriately describes the particular product.” The Vegetarian Resource Group specifically addressed the issue of consumer education in their comment: “The use of a term such as ‘engineered using cultured seafood cells’ would help consumers understand that the product is based on seafood and that seafood cells are used in production. An educational program would need to be developed to inform consumers about the meaning of ‘cultured’ in this context.” All documents and statements on the subject can be found on the US government’s website and can be freely read there. Although European Parliament President Ursula von der Leyen continues to push for her Green Deal, it says little about cultured meat so far. Last year, however, the European Union made its first investments in a laboratory meat project. The Spanish “Meat4All” project received 2.7 million euros in research and development funding. In Germany is still no officially prescribed name for meat from the bioreactor. However, official documents of the Bundestag currently always refer to “In-Vitro Meat (IVF)”. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) will probably give it a uniform name in Germany in the coming months or years. So far, cultured meat has been called “lab-grown meat” in official documents of the European Research Committee.    "
9912,"Cultured Meat: From Science Fiction to a Fantastic Business Opportunity
by Prof. Dr. Nick Lin-H, University of Vechta, Germany",https://vegconomist.com/cell-cultured/cultured-meat-from-science-fiction-to-a-fantastic-business-opportunityby-prof-dr-nick-lin-h-university-of-vechta-germany/,2021-03-12,"When the world’s first cellular burger was publicly presented in December, 2013, the idea of cultivating meat in a laboratory was shrug off as pure science fiction. Seven years later, the vision of cultured meat has become reality: Chicken nuggets from cultured meat are now being served in a restaurant in Singapore since December 2020. Cultured meat heralds a paradigm shift in the production of meat as it is manufactured by in-vitro cultivation of animal cells. In doing so, cultured meat breaks with the logic of producing meat through livestock farming and animal slaughter. The idea of cultured meat hits the current zeitgeist. A growing number of people are changing their nutrition habits and are therefore breaking with their traditional consumption patterns. This explains the recent meteoric rise of plant-based meat alternatives. The new generation of plant-based meat alternatives from companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have successfully entered the mass market backed by a clever strategy: They target consumers who derive pleasure from eating meat, yet still wish to reduce their overall meat consumption. These changing consumer preferences open up a new market segment with highly profitable investment opportunities. While plant-based meat alternatives imitate meat products, cultured meat is a perfect substitute for conventional meat. Ultimately, it will be impossible to distinguish cultured meat from its conventional counterpart: it smells, looks, and tastes the same. Contrary to plant-based meat alternatives, cultured meat does not target a specific customer group, but appeals to all meat consumers. This is precisely what gives rise to cultured meat’s immense business opportunities. The features of cultured meat allow for a quick market penetration, which constitutes its huge economic potential and renders it highly attractive for businesses. Cultured meat not only promises high growth rates in the next years, but also holds the prospect to become one of the fastest-growing market segments in the food industry. Indeed, it is projected that by 2040, the global market for cultured meat will reach $630 billion. Moreover, the technology behind cultured meat allows creating entirely new products and business models in the food sector. For example, cultured meat allows to design meat products with additional value (“functional food”) and hence, offers the chance to tap into the highly profitable market for tailor-made nutrition. Therefore, companies that begin to explore cultured meat now lay the foundation for boosting their profits and strengthening their long-term competitive position in the future. As part of his research on the future of agriculture and nutrition, Prof. Dr. Nick Lin-Hi has already been dealing with cultured meat since several years. He is one of the leading experts for cultured meat in Germany and is regularly involved in discussions about its relevance with representatives from business and politics. As professor for business and ethics, he is researching and teaching at the University of Vechta and thus, in Germany’s hotspot of intensive animal farming. TV, radio, and various online and print media are regularly reporting about his work. What is your stance on cultured meat? Share your perspective in our scientific survey.

Cultured meat has a high potential to substantially reduce the environmental footprint of the meat industry and thus, contribute to sustainable development. Studies predict that compared to conventional meat production, cultured meat will emit up to 90% less greenhouse gases. Thus, the market diffusion of cultured meat can make a significant contribution to the mitigation of global warming. Moreover, cultured meat holds the prospect to improve global food security as its production is independent from climate and land quality. Taken together, cultured meat has the power to initiate a transition in the meat industry and bring it on a more sustainable path.

9931,New GFI Studies Reveal Cost of Meat From Cells Could Drop to $2.57 Per Pound by 2030,https://vegconomist.com/studies-and-numbers/new-gfi-studies-reveal-cost-of-meat-from-cells-could-drop-to-2-57-per-pound-by-2030/,2021-03-09,"As the cultivated meat revolution gathers pace around the world, two first-of-a-kind studies have proven that cell-based meat provides major benefits to the climate and environment. The studies, which were supported by the Good Food Institute, show that cultivated meat could be cost-competitive with multiple forms of slaughtered animal meat by 2030.  The main findings from the study demonstrate that, when compared with beef from cows, cultivated meat can result in up to 92% less global warming and 93% less air pollution, as well as 95% less land. When renewable energy is used in the production of both forms, 78% less water is used. These significant findings add to the growing amount of evidence that the future of meat is cell-based in the race to net-zero emissions.  The studies model a future large-scale cultivated meat production facility and show that by 2030, the cost of meat grown from cells when manufactured at scale could drop to $5.66 per kg ($2.57 per pound). The two studies – a life cycle assessment and techno-economic assessment – are the first reports to be informed by data contributed by companies involved in the cultivated meat supply chain. Over 15 companies participated, including five cultivated meat manufacturers. Beyond emissions, the global human health benefits associated with cell-based production are huge in terms of zoonotic disease transmission and antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, with animal meat using up to 19 times more land than cultivated beef, a transition from animal agriculture to cultivated meat production will free up land to restore ecosystems and sequester carbon. Not to mention the ethical concerns regarding the needless slaughter of billions of animals every year.  GFI Senior Scientist Elliot Swartz: “As soon as 2030, we expect to see real progress on costs for cultivated meat and massive reductions in emissions and land use brought about by the transition to this method of meat production. This research signals a vote of confidence and serves as a practical roadmap for the industry to address technical and economic bottlenecks, which will further reduce climate impacts and costs. Government investment in R&D and infrastructure will be critical to accelerating the development of cultivated meat and help us achieve global climate goals. Favorable policies and carbon markets can incentivize the restoration of agricultural land for its carbon sequestration and ecosystem services potential, maximizing the climate benefits of cultivated meat.”     "
9944,India Sees Huge Growth in Vegan Options as Plant-Based Eating Continues to Rise,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/india-sees-huge-growth-in-vegan-options-as-plant-based-eating-continues-to-rise/,2021-03-08,"India is well-known for having a large vegetarian population, and many Indians are now turning to veganism due to health concerns. As plant-based eating grows, companies like Evolved Foods and Nutiva are working to meet rising demand.  A survey in 2019 found that 63% of Indians were willing to replace meat with plant-based options. That’s a big market in a country of over a billion people. While vegetarianism is well-established in the country, dairy plays a heavy role in the traditional Indian diet. Until recently, vegan options were relatively hard to come by. But that’s beginning to change. For example, Evolved Foods has introduced vegan alternatives under its Alt Meat and Alt Protein brands, seeking to replace chicken and paneer (an Indian soft cheese). And Dutch company Schouten recently brought its tempeh production system to India. Meanwhile, Nutiva has launched vegan ghee (clarified butter), while Epigamia and Axia Food have both introduced vegan yogurts. Indian liquid egg replacer company EVO Foods is also experiencing increasing success. And there’s growing demand for pre-prepared foods, with vegan ready meal sales soaring. Western brands such as Starbucks and Domino’s are also launching vegan options in India, while organisations like GFI India are working to advance the Indian alt-protein industry. There are advances in cultured meat too, with Indian company Clear Meat developing lab-grown chicken mince that it claims is as affordable as the conventional variety. Back in 2019, the Indian government began subsidising clean meat research, and studies suggest Indian consumers are more open to it than Westerners. “Indian businesses and scientists have immense potential to be at the centre of this development [towards plant-based foods], driving affordability and sensory experiences as well as cultural appeal in transformative plant-based foods,” said Varun Deshpande, Managing Director at GFI India.

Aleph Farms, Ltd., and BRF S.A., a global Brazilian meat and food company, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to bring cultivated meat to the Brazilian dinner table. BRF will distribute Aleph’s cultivated beef products across Brazil.   Representatives of the company state that this agreement will allow BRF to reduce its environmental impact, not to be overlooked when one considers the environmental impact that Brazilians have seen in their country as a direct result of animal agriculture. BRF is one of the largest meat producers in the world, reporting revenue of approximately BRL 39 billion (approximately USD 7.25 billion). Aleph Farms, which recently revealed the world’s first cultivated ribeye steak, will co-develop and produce cultivated meat with BRF using its patented production platforms (BioFarm™). Didier Toubia, Co-Founder and CEO of Aleph Farms: “We are thrilled to join forces with BRF, a global food and meat industries leader. This new partnership advances Aleph Farms’ strategy to integrate into the existing ecosystem as part of our go-to-market plans. Leveraging the expertise and infrastructure of leading food and meat companies will drive a faster scale-up of cultivated meat and eventually lead to a broader positive impact. As one of the largest beef producers in the world, Brazil is a strategic market for us. We have been impressed by the strong commitment from BRF management to innovation and sustainability. We are convinced that shared values are the key to a successful long-term partnership.” Lorival Luz, CEO of BRF: “BRF is ready and charged to play a leading role in this food revolution and be an active participant in one the greatest industry transformations of this generation. Since 2014, we have witnessed an increasing global demand for new sources of protein driven by several factors, namely environmental concerns, new diets and lifestyles, which has spurred the growth of new dietary genres including flexitarianism, vegetarianism and more.”      "
9967,Ocean Hugger Foods is Back and Stronger Than Ever With New Partnership ,https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/ocean-hugger-foods-is-back-and-stronger-than-ever-with-new-partnership/,2021-03-02,"After the Covid-19 crisis forced Ocean Hugger to cease operations last year, the outlook was bleak for the US plant-based seafood company. Good news is at hand however, as Ocean Hugger is relaunching via a new partnership with Thailand’s Nove Foods, a subsidiary of publicly listed NRF.  Founded in 2016 to produce plant-based seafood alternatives, the company grew rapidly in the emerging plant-based seafood industry. By 2020, it was selling plant-based tuna and eel to foodservice customers across the US, Canada, Caribbean, and UK. However, when the pandemic broke out, the foodservice industry was hit hard as restaurants around the world closed down. Ocean Hugger was forced into closure.  Founders David Benzaquen and James Corwell did not lose hope and now Ocean Hugger Foods is back in partnership with Thailand-based food manufacturer Nove Foods Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of NR Instant Produce Public Company Limited (NRF). NRF is a leading global manufacturer of sustainably produced foods with export operations in 30 countries. The company officially launched on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in 2020 marking it as the very first public Thai company in the plant based category. Subsidiary Nove Foods is at the cutting-edge of plant-based foods with a mission to be the world’s leading co-manufacturer of alternative protein ingredients and products. Co-Founder and CEO David Benzaquen told vegconomist, “Over 20 years ago, I personally went plant-based in part because of my concern over the suffering of billions of fish and the destruction of our oceans. Building a pioneering plant-based seafood brand like Ocean Hugger has been a privilege and I’m so happy to see it enter this new stage”. Through their new strategic joint venture Ocean Hugger, Inc., the initial founders and Nove Foods are preparing for a global launch of an expanded portfolio of plant-based seafood products in both retail and foodservice in late 2021.

One such company is Next Gen, which reveals today it has closed what it says is the largest seed round ever in the plant-based sector at $10 million, and also announces the launch of TiNDLE, its new plant-based chicken brand.  Next Gen is the brainchild of Timo Recker and Andre Menezes, CEO and COO respectively. Founder Timo Recker was previously behind plant meat producer LikeMeat, which was 100% acquired by The LIVEKINDLY Collective last year. Co-founder Andre Menezes was previously Managing Director of Country Foods Singapore, where he was involved in making Impossible Foods a household name in Singapore. In recent years he has played a key role in the introduction of plant proteins throughout Asia. TiNDLE is set to launch in restaurants in the city-state next month. Fresh funds from the record-breaking seed round will be used for the global launch of the alt-meat startup’s consumer brand as well as continued R+D of new plant-based products. Based on data from PitchBook, Next Gen claims it to be the largest seed round ever raised by a plant-based food tech company. As reported by vegconomist, Next Gen previously raised seed financing of $2.2 million after launching last October. The new financing, which features investors Temasek, K3 Ventures, New Ventures (an arm of the Singapore Economic Development Board), and German wholesaler Metro’s NX-Food, is the first time the startup has taken external investment. Impressively, the funding far exceeded its original target of $7 million.  Watch theTiNDLE video here: Click here to display content from YouTube.

Located in Jakarta, the company claims to be the first plant-based meat producer in the Southeast Asian country, developing chicken and beef alternatives using natural, whole-food ingredients.   vegconomist recently reported on Green Butcher’s upcoming collaboration with Starbucks in Indonesia, and this seed round funding will be used to scale up production in anticipation of this partnership, along with launching into mainstream retailers in Q2 2021. The funding will also be used to support additional R&D hiring.  Green Butcher was founded by Max Mandias and Helga Angelina, the founders of Burgreens, the largest vegan restaurant chain in Indonesia. The company’s range includes products such as Chick’n Satay, Chick’n Karaage, Beefless Chunks, Beefless Rendang and Shroom Balls, which are all sold ready to cook. The focus is on creating plant-based products that are specifically developed to go well with Asian comfort food and tastes. “This investment will help us take advantage of the opportunity we see to become the leading consumer brand for plant-based foods that are tailored to the Asian palate,” said Helga Angelina, co-founder and CEO.   “Green Butcher is doing important work in Indonesia and we are honoured to be able to support their ongoing growth and development in an often-overlooked segment of the alternative protein market,” said Kim Odhner, Managing Partner, Europe & Asia, with Unovis Asset Management. “Helga Angelina and the entire team have made impressive progress over the past year, and Unovis aims to leverage its unique experience and industry position to help launch this innovative plant-based powerhouse to a global audience.

9995,New Partnership Poses Algae-Based Foods As Next New Wave For Australia,https://vegconomist.com/agriculture/new-partnership-poses-algae-based-foods-as-next-new-wave-for-australia/,2021-02-24,"Flinders University of Southern Australia is to lend its scientific support to utilising innovative Australian marine bioproducts in plant-based foods. The move could pave the way for Australia to become a major player in the booming seaweed economy, as more and more food producers discover its myriad benefits.   The Centre for Marine Bioproducts Development at Flinders University has teamed up with Australian Kelp Products Pty Ltd to produce new seaweed-derived ingredients and functional food products for the vegan market. Australia’s vast amount of coast holds a multitude of renewable bioresources, presenting a great opportunity to enter the international marine bioproducts market, which analysts predict to exceed USD $92 billion by 2025. Founder and Director of the Flinders CMBD, Professor Zhang, says that Australia holds a unique opportunity within its Exclusive Economic Zone – an area spanning ten million square kilometres of marine territory. “Australia has unique marine biological diversity,” he says. “Nearly 70% of our marine biota is unique to our region, and marine biotechnology builds on this natural asset.” Japan, China and South Korea are the current market leaders for edible algaes, having included seaweeds into their native diet for centuries, though over recent years Western consumers have become increasingly aware of the benefits of its bioactive compounds and essential vitamins and minerals which can promote gut, skin and brain health. Algae is also an extremely versatile resource, as South Korean cell-based startup SeaWith has demonstrated by developing a cell culture scaffold for cultivated meat made with microalgae.  Other vegan food producers find themselves ahead of the curve, with The Dutch Weed Burger company opting to use seaweed as a highly sustainable protein source that grows quickly without freshwater or fertilisers. Paris-based Algaia and California-based Trophic are also developing algae products for use in the plant-based food sector. The seaweed snacks market is expected to garner USD $2.9 billion by 2027.  “South Australia has almost 15% of the world’s recorded diversity for red and brown seaweeds, which are the most commercially valuable species. But we don’t have endless quantities to use for commercial production,” explains Professor Zhang. “The good news is that experts predict that Australia’s pristine environment and strict regulatory practices put it in a prime position to become a major global player in the years to come.“    "

10000,The VeganKind: “Many Brands Have Said That TVK Really Helped Pave the Way For Their Growth and Success”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/the-vegankind-many-brands-have-said-that-tvk-really-helped-pave-the-way-for-their-growth-and-success/,2021-02-23,"The VeganKind is a well-established, fast-growing, and hugely popular vegan delivery box producer based in Scotland. Here at vegconomist we have reported on this founder-couple’s string of successes on a seemingly constant basis, and this is a much-loved company to so many in the UK – so it was way overdue that we had a chat about their incredible success in the plant-based market.  We finally, and happily, got to speak to Co-Founder and CEO Scott McCulloch, who along with wife Karris, operates the UK’s leading 100% vegan and plant-based e-commerce / delivery box platform. While most of our UK readers will be familiar with the VeganKind, please introduce your brand to our global readers.
We are TheVeganKind, and our mission is to make a vegan lifestyle easily accessible to all! We have monthly subscription boxes which arrive at your doorstep showing you new and exciting vegan products each month, and we also have the UK’s leading 100% vegan and plant-based online store, TheVeganKind Supermarket! TheVeganKind started out back in 2013, how did you come up with the idea for the business and what difficulties did you face at that time? What are some of the biggest or most surprising changes you have seen in these 8 years?
So, the initial idea was conceived by Karris, my co-founder (and wife). We had been experimenting with veganism and knew that people were more likely to stick to it if it was made easier for them. We knew of the subscription box market and the growing trend of subscription products, but no one in the UK was doing a vegan one. One night, Karris mentioned it would be cool if we could set one up – and from that moment on, we never looked back. The business has changed immeasurably since then. Back then it was just Karris and I, packing boxes through the night in our flat, with a baby and dog at our feet, whereas now we are a team of 60+, operating out a 35,000 square foot warehouse! Some of the difficulties we faced at that time were centred around cashflow and thusly our ability to invest in the business. We hadn’t raised any money, and didn’t have any staff, and we both had full-time jobs. So TVK was founded on sheer grit, hard work and determination. We used every spare penny we earned to get the business up and running. In terms of surprising changes – we had something like five vegan cheeses when we launched TVK Supermarket – but we now have over 200+! I don’t think I would have forecast that amount of vegan cheese! Around this time last year, you successfully ran a crowdfunding campaign raising over £300,000 target in just 2 days, how do you attribute this success?
We spent a lot of time preparing our followers and customers about this unique opportunity to own a piece of TVK. We really do feel we have played our part in the growth of veganism over the last seven years, amassing a total social following of over 600,000 people on Instagram alone. This meant we had plenty of people to shout to about our raise. We actually ended up raising over £600k with over 2,500 people joining, making it the most supported vegan crowdraise the UK had ever seen at that time! Since then, of course, the world has suffered the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. How has this new business landscape affected your sales, and where do you see TheVeganKind in a post-Covid age?
When Covid hit it was like our business was sucked up into a tornado! Our order volumes just kept going up and up as more and more people were panicking and trying hard to access food and drink. It was actually quite a scary time and we really did feel a burden of responsibility to get food and drink out to as many people as possible. We ended up limiting the amount of any one product that people could buy, and limiting the maximum basket size, just so we could service the very maximum amount of people. Sales grew to such a volume that we ended up having to move warehouse in the middle of a pandemic (hopefully for the first and last time), but that then gave us a platform to really go on and grow from in 2021. A post-Covid age TVK is going to see even more people curious about what ‘vegan’ or ‘plant based’ even means. People that have half an eye on the future and who want to contribute to a more equitable and harmonious ecosystem. People that when they find out about it, will feel very aligned to TheVeganKind. Which products would you say are your biggest sellers and why?
Dairy and meat replacement products such as THIS Isn’t Bacon, Applewood Cheese, Tofurky, Heura and soon OmniPork – those types of products are always popular. Products that taste so good/realistic that people say ‘Wow, I can’t believe that’s vegan’. We also sell a tonne of vegan chocolate, because really, who doesn’t love delicious, creamy milky vegan chocolate! You also recently moved into a new facility which is eleven times bigger than your previous location, can you tell us a little about the move and what this has meant for The VeganKind?
We were trading out of a warehouse that was not serving our growth ambitions. People now expect TVK to have the latest products as soon as they arrive on the market, and in order for us to continue serving our customers in this way we just simply had to move to larger premises, and I am so glad we did. Our new TVK HQ has provided the platform we needed for this next level of growth. We can scale up here and continue to expand different departments without worrying we will run out of space. It has given us a fresh start. A new beginning. And we could not be more excited for the future! Could you tell us about TVK+, your new loyalty scheme?
Sure! TVK+ is our membership scheme that allows customers to shop at TVK Supermarket and see over 50% of the products at a discounted price. TVK+ membership is currently free to our subscription box customers. Basically, if you are reading this right now and you are already a subscriber to one of our boxes – pop on over to TVK Supermarket, login and voila, you will see 2,500 products at a discount! You will also see a different banner on the home page, letting you know what that month’s “hero” products are where we have achieved extra special discounts for you, such as for February where TVK+ customers will get a huge 26% off One Planet Pizza products! Do you have any other exciting plans for the future that you can share with us?
We have a range of meals coming out this week under our new sub-brand, Love Plants! We have 3 varieties – Chick’n Arrabiata, Chick’n Korma and a Thai Green Chick’n. All three products use THIS Isn’t Chicken in the meals and they are absolutely DELICIOUS! When Karris and I tried them for the first time, we looked at each other and said at the same time ‘Wow, those are the best vegan meals I’ve ever tasted!” We are really excited to launch. Watch this space! We plan on doing a lot more NPD in the coming 24 months. Also, more repeat purchasing. If you have 5-10 staples that you simply must have in your fridge, then let us deliver them to you on a subscription-basis without lifting a finger! We will roll this feature out to a select group of TVK+ customers at first and then work on growing that service. We also expect to launch a marketplace in H2 this year. No one really knows about that bit yet, but broadly speaking we have the infrastructure being worked on and just need to roadmap it out, and then launch! We want lots of smaller, artisan brands to be able to benefit from the TVK brand as it grows. We can direct traffic to their brand on the marketplace and then they can deal with the fulfilment of the orders and service of the customers. It means we can continue to help support as many small, independent vegan businesses as possible. Many brands have said before that TVK really helped pave the way for their growth and success when we either featured them in our subscription box or listed them in our supermarket – and we don’t want that feeling to stop as we grow. And finally, as CEO of a successful and rapidly growing vegan company, what trends and directions do you predict for the plant-based business world in 2021?
I think we are going to continue to see immense amounts of innovation. The alternative proteins market is growing rapidly, with new tastes, flavours, textures, synergies and breakthroughs. Right now, someone is working on the next big thing – the next liquid egg replacement – the next vegan caviar – the next vegan foie gras – the next vegan tuna steak – even the next vegan fried egg! It is all coming, and coming in abundance. Soon enough, there will be no reason to eat animals as there will be alternatives for everything you can imagine, and loads of options in each category. That is the world I love the sound of, and one I feel with TVK we are heavily contributing to. Onwards and upwards. Plant Power all the way!    "

The funding represents further investment in the cell-based sphere, with various big players ramping up development globally.  The third and final round of $10m brings the total raised in the round to $85m. The Maastricht-based company recently made huge steps towards achieving its mission of reshaping global food systems by successfully developing animal-free media and reducing the cost of production by 88 times. Mosa Meat will use the latest funds to extend its current pilot production facility, develop an industrial-sized production line, expand its team and introduce cultivated beef to consumers.  The significant funding investment is further evidence of what the GFI named the ‘new space race for the future of food’. Not just in Europe but across the globe, cell-based food startups have been experiencing breakthrough after breakthrough. Singapore became the first country in the world to approve cultivated meat for sale just two months ago. Last week, Aleph Farms of Israel claimed to have cultivated the very first ribeye steak, and last week also saw cellbased developments coming from South Korea. Mosa Meat’s Series B funding round was led by Blue Horizon Ventures, the food tech fund headed by Michael Kleindl. The serial entrepreneurs aim to support and promote a positive global impact on the environment, human health and animal welfare, with special focus on plant-based, cultured meat and synthetic biology. “We are delighted to extend our collaboration with existing partners, and welcome new partners in this round,” said Maarten Bosch, CEO of Mosa Meat. “The closing of Series B funding brings us one step closer to our mission to develop a cleaner, kinder way of making real beef. Our partners bring immense strategic capabilities and expertise, and share our strong commitment to increasing the sustainability of our global food system.”    "
10011,Life Is Sweet When Plant-based Meat Is on 60 Minutes,https://vegconomist.com/plantbased-business-hour/life-is-sweet-when-plant-based-meat-is-on-60-minutes/,2021-02-22,"Every week, Plant-based Business Expert Elysabeth Alfano breaks down the headlines with her review and analysis in the Plantbased Business Minute.  Elysabeth is the founder of Plant Powered Consulting, the host of  the Plantbased Business Hour and the Consulting Managing Director, vegconomist, North America. She doesn’t use a teleprompter. Here is the Plantbased Business Minute for the week ending February 19, 2021. You don’t need to be perfect to make an impact. Bill Gates takes to 60 Minutes to talk about reversing climate change in anticipation of his new book coming out, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.   In the 60 Minutes discussion with Anderson Cooper, Gates talks about switching out animal meats for plant-based meats. He names Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. He also talks about growing microbes as a source of alternative protein. He and Anderson then go on to taste Nature’s Fynd’s non-animal yogurt which is so delicious. I know this because I have tasted all of their products. Immediately after airing, Nature’s Fynd put out a pre-market launch of their non-animal breakfast sausage and their non-animal cream cheese which sold out in 24 hours.  Indeed, Bill Gates went on to say that he couldn’t tell the difference between a Nature’s Fynd burger and animal meat. My business bottom line is this: while Bill Gates is not really a perfect messenger, I mean he took Anderson Cooper to a burger bar to discuss climate change, so- you know, that’s a rookie mistake, he is a perfect flexitarian. And in that way this imperfect messenger is really a perfect person to drive change. Click here to display content from YouTube.

The Moonshot Collaborative plant-based market research company tells us that three out of four plant-based consumers are willing to spend up to 20 percent more on plant-based options. Gen X, Y, and Z- to the tune of 72 percent, 81 percent, and 92 percent respectively-are all willing to spend more. It’s probably no surprise that only 62 percent of those who identify as meat eaters are willing to spend more on plant-based foods. My business bottom line is usually we talk about taste, price, and convenience, but really now that we have so many plant-based options and Bill Gates can’t even tell the difference, really the only thing that matters to us at this point is price.  When the price is comparable or lower than meat, that’s when you’ll see the dominos fall really quickly and life will be sweet. Sweet like Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, York Peppermint Patty, Hershey’s Kisses, and Kit Kat. They all have gotten a vegan makeover. Adidas is the 1500th company to ban fur, and BMW says that when its new mini comes out, it will be one hundred percent vegan. My business bottom line here is a couple things. First of all, to those companies that are not yet plant-based, it’s all about survival of the fittest. At this point, go plant-based or die. My second business bottom line is to the MSNBC reporter who said that when they saw that Kit Kat was going plant-based they thought it meant that it was going to be made with green vegetables and therefore they didn’t want anything to do with it, I really suggest that you take a Home Economics class so that you can understand how chocolate is grown, my friend. I have one question for you as I leave you for the week. More and more companies are adding plant-based lines: one line, two lines, three product lines, but at the same time they’re not reducing their meat and dairy lines. In fact, perhaps they’re even investing more in things like chicken production. At what point is a company part of the solution and no longer part of the problem? Come find me on LinkedIn to have that discussion. This has been the Plantbased Business minute.  If you would like a deeper dive into plant-based business, please subscribe to the Plantbased Business Hour wherever you get your podcasts. And if you are a small plant-based business or a large meat and dairy company and you are looking to navigate the plant-based landscape, please reach out to me on LinkedIn. My team and I at Plant Powered Consulting are here to help you with media, marketing, communications strategy and so much more. Until I see you again next week, remember that together we are taking back our health, the health of the planet, and the health of our bottom line.

10020,"AFFPP On Plant-Based Growth in Russia “We’re Obviously Thrilled Not Only to Witness it, But to Be At the Origin Of This Change”",https://vegconomist.com/interviews/affpp-on-plant-based-growth-in-russia-were-obviously-thrilled-not-only-to-witness-it-but-to-be-at-the-origin-of-this-change/,2021-02-18,"Great news for Russia was announced earlier this month as the country is now set to host its first plant-based incubator programme. In collaboration with ProVeg International, the newly-formed Association of Alternative Food Producers (AAFPP), has been established by Julia Marsel and Tim Ponomarev, two of the founders of the ProVeg Incubator alumni startup Greenwise.  The incubator, based in the Moscow and Kaluga region, will be ready for its first cohort of startups this spring. We were excited to speak with Co-Founders Julia and Tim about this excellent development for the Russian plant-based market. As a newly formed organisation, please tell us what the AAFPP is and what you do?
AFFPP stands for Association of alternative food products producers. It’s a non-profit organization for manufacturers and developers of alternatives to foods of animal origin. Being a first alt-protein NGO in Russia and the CIS countries, its aim is to unite people who’re transforming nutrition. We’re helping enthusiastic, like-minded companies to grow and collectively develop the market for alternative products in Russia and Russian-speaking countries. You claim to be an industry first in Russia, why do you think now is the right time to start?
Over the last two years, we’ve seen a considerable growth of the alt-protein sector in the Russian-speaking countries. Today, plant-based foods are produced not only by vegan manufactures but also by big meat & oil processing companies. We’ve witnessed how rapidly plant-based products appeared on the federal retail chain stores shelves and how dashingly they’re taking over the HoReCa segment. At the same time, we see that many alt-protein companies use outdated marketing tools, they don’t operate fresh market data, target solely vegans and vegetarians and neglect flexitarian consumers. We believe that in order to see this market flourish, we need to provide producers with knowledge and expertise that AAFPP’s partners have and we, as ProVeg Incubator alumni, have gained. You’re preparing to welcome your first start-ups on board, can you tell us some more about them?
It’s a little bit too early to talk about the first cohort of AAFPP’s incubator since we plan to launch it in late spring of 2021. Right now we’re in the process of recruiting members and partners of the Association and we think it will take 1-2 more months. What feelings do you have about the broader plant-based scene in Russia at present?
Russian and the CIS alternative food market is very young. Despite that, it’s been growing faster than we expected. For example, in January 2019 the plant-based meat market consisted of four vegan companies. These products were being sold in niche vegan stores in the outskirts of big cities. Today, plant-based meat is produced by 12 companies, three of which are meat-processing businesses and two are oil processors. Meat alternatives are easily accessed and can be found in every retail chain and online marketplace. Overall, alt-protein foods are going from niche to mainstream. We’re obviously thrilled not only to witness it, but to be at the origin of this change. You were founders of Greenwise, one of the very first plant-based meat companies in Russia. What skills or experiences from this business have you learned which will help you in your new role?
The Russian market lags behind the European market by 3-5 years and the US by 5-7 years. We were fortunate to take part in the 2nd cohort of ProVeg Incubator and have our vision set by the more developed markets. For us, graduating from the Incubator was like time-travelling. We saw and experienced things that are only just about to happen in our market. This is why we’re more prepared than our competitors – we can anticipate events and be the drivers of FoodTech in Russia. Although two years have passed, we’re still closely in touch with the Incubator, as well as with European, Asian and American plant- and cell-based community. This connection allows us to be aware of all the trends in our sector and obtain unique insights. Please elaborate on your relationship with ProVeg.
As for Greenwise, ProVeg Incubator was one of the most important milestones. The program boosted us and allowed us to become the leading manufacturer of plant-based meats on our market. In regard to AAFPP, ProVeg Incubator became a key partner of the Association with whose help and based on whose expertise/knowledge we’ll launch Russia’s and the CIS’s first alternative protein market. What are the most important trends for the AAFPP looking to the future?
The most important trend for AAFPP is food transformation: to move away from conventional meat production to the production of plant-based alternatives, and then to cultivated ones.    "
10034,Japan: Alternative Meat Startup Next Meats Holdings Gets Listed on the American OTC Market,https://vegconomist.com/trade/japan-alternative-meat-startup-next-meats-holdings-gets-listed-on-the-american-otc-market/,2021-02-17,"Japanese alternative meat company Next Meats Holdings, became listed on the American OTC Market on January 26th as NEXT MEATS HOLDINGS, INC (NXMH) after acquiring an American SPAC, paving its path into the American stock market. The rapidly growing company thus enters the US stock market with plans for worldwide expansion and NASDAQ listing in the future.  Next Meats Holdings aims to be listed on NASDAQ in the future and plans to invest its resources into their product development, distribution, and relevant corporations. As people all over the world are shifting their lifestyles and countries becoming more concerned with realizing the Sustainable Development Goals, alternative meat companies like Next Meats can be expected to grow even more.  A Tokyo-based food-tech venture company specializing in the R&D of Japanese-style alternative meat products, Next Meats began its product development in 2017 and was officially established in 2020, when they simultaneously began their international expansion.  Their plant-based products Next Burgers, Next Gyudon (beef bowl), and the Next Yakiniku series have been released at a notable pace, and they are rapidly developing new products as well. Even in the growing market with many emerging competitors, the company’s strong presence has been proven by its robust collaboration with Yakinku Like, a leading Japanese barbecue chain restaurant with stores all across Japan. This collaboration enabled the world’s first plant-based Yakiniku meats “Next Kalbi” and “Next Harami” (short-rib steak and skirt steak style, respectively) to be enjoyed right alongside regular animal meat menu items throughout Japan and in the chain’s other stores in Asia. The collaboration was so popular that although it was started as a limited-time collaboration, it has been extended with no set date of ending. Next Meats has also established a new production site in Vietnam and has signed a joint product development agreement with Hoya, one of the world’s largest alternative meat companies in Taiwan, in January 2021.  The products are set to launch from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Vietnam in March. In December 2020, the company also announced its partnership agreement with Toyota Tsusho, a multi-market trading enterprise, and the Toyota Group Companies’ affiliate. Next Meats plans to continue working with universities and other venture corporations to conduct further research on plant-based proteins as well as microalgae and cultured meats. They earnestly aim to replace all animal-based products by 2050, aligned with their mission “Not Letting the Earth End”. Next Meats Holdings, Inc.

10035,World’s Largest Tuna Brand Thai Union to Launch Vegan Shrimp as Thai Market Thrives,https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/worlds-largest-tuna-brand-thai-union-to-launch-vegan-shrimp-as-thai-market-thrives/,2021-02-17,"Tuna giant Thai Union, which owns brands including John West and Chicken of the Sea, is to debut a plant-based shrimp in 2021. The launch comes in response to increased demand for vegan seafood globally, as well as a growing shift towards plant-based diets in Thailand, a country where big players continue to enter the plant-based sector.  Thai Union is taking part in a €10 million ($11 million) vegan ingredients initiative backed by the European Commission, as reported last October by Farming Independent. As such, the company plans to add further plant-based products to its range and target international markets and the foodservice sector.  Thai Union’s vegan shrimp will be a tempura-style product, following on from recent launches of its first plant-based products, which included crabcakes and dim sum for the foodservice sector. The company is a leading global supplier of seafood products to the US and Europe as well as the world’s largest canned-tuna processor. Its continued expansion into the plant-based sector is a response to consumer demand, principally from the rising flexitarian trend.   Thailand, a country of close to 70 million people, has seen remarkable growth in the plant-based sector lately. The country’s largest agribusiness firm, Charoen Pokphand Foods, is launching its own line of plant-based meat substitutes and Loma Linda recently announced increased production of its TUNO product, establishing the first facility in the country fully dedicated to plant-based food production. NR Instant Produce officially launched on the Stock Exchange of Thailand last year making it the first public plant-based Thai company, raising around $51.4 million in its IPO. Furthermore, alternative meat startup Let’s Plant Meat has designs on becoming the Thai Beyond Meat, with its CEO claiming that “people in Thailand are wanting healthier foods and more environmentally friendly products,” in an interview with vegconomist.  Plant-based seafood is one of the hottest sectors at the moment, with companies all over the world responding to the growing customer demand for alternative protein, from innovative startups like Kuleana to larger and more established names like Good Catch, to global corporates such as Nestlé. The vegan seafood market, however, is generally seen as in its infancy, with the challenges of replicating taste and texture requiring more research and development than its plant-based meat counterpart. “We have had consumers come to us and say, ‘I know you are an expert in seafood and shrimp; I would like to have a shrimp tempura, but not containing shrimp,’” Thai Union Innovation Direction Tunyawat Kasemsuwan told seafood business site Undercurrent News. “Hopefully this year you will see even more products, around the world, [that are] plant-based from us. Shrimp should be in a few months,” he continued.    "
10044,World’s First Cell-Based Collagen Product ‘Zellulin’ is Revealed by Avant,https://vegconomist.com/fashion-und-beauty/worlds-first-cell-based-collagen-product-zellulin-is-revealed-by-avant/,2021-02-16,"Hong Kong’s Avant is known to vegconomist readers as the first cultivated meat company in China, whose proprietary technology platform produces animal-free fish proteins for various applications ranging from food to skincare. Avant today announces today the launch of Zellulin®, the world’s first cell-based functional protein for the cosmeceutical functional ingredient market.  Following its US$3.1 million seed round funding last year, Avant aims to be a global leader in producing functional, safe, and sustainable cultivated marine products in a fully contained environment. With Zellulin, Avant’s utilises its cell culture biotechnology to enter the US$52.5 billion global anti-aging product market. The product contains multi-functional marine protein peptides that promote anti-oxidation, regeneration, and repairing of skin more effectively than collagen alone as per quantitative studies. It can be incorporated into formulas of moisturizers, drinks, and supplements. Carrie Chan, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Avant said, “We are excited to launch our first commercialized product, Zellulin®. This pioneering bioactive ingredient answers the quest of the market for sustainable and innovative alternatives. We welcome partnership with cosmeceutical companies to develop new, ethical and sustainable products with us.”     "
10048,New Age Meats Raises $2M Ahead of Upcoming Series A Round,https://vegconomist.com/investments/new-age-meats-raises-2m-ahead-of-upcoming-series-a-round/,2021-02-15,"Californian cultured meat startup New Age Meats has raised $2M in funding via convertible debt. This seed extension funding brings the total amount raised by the company to $7M.  After a successful seed funding round last year, New Age Meats is aiming for a Series A round in 2021. The additional funding will allow it to bring its hybrid cultured and plant-based pork products to market more quickly. To this end, it has hired several former Impossible Foods employees, as well as bioengineers with experience in product development and scaling. Cultured meat is beginning to take off worldwide, with the EU investing 2.7M euros in cultured meat biotech, UC Davis receiving $3.5M from the US government for research, and China considering a national strategy to allow it to make progress in developing lab-grown meat. New Age Meats’ first products are pork sausages and dumplings, which according to the company are more realistic than any others currently available. But as with all cultured meat products, making them affordable is the biggest challenge. “Ultimately, we will fail if our products are too expensive and low volume to be served anywhere but luxury restaurants,” says Brian Spears, the company’s CEO. “We’ve focused relentlessly on driving down the cost and scaling production of our product: hybrid cultivated and plant-based meat that doesn’t sacrifice on flavour. We want to make the world a better place by making the better decisions easy. We are well on our way to bringing that vision to market after our upcoming Series A.”    "
10051,"CellulaREvolution Raises £1M, Aims to Transform Cultured Meat Production",https://vegconomist.com/investments/cellularevolution-raises-1m-aims-to-transform-cultured-meat-production/,2021-02-15,"British cell-based meat company CellulaREvolution has raised £1M in its latest funding round, with investors including Orange Light Ventures, CPT Capital, and the Northern Accelerator Seed Investment Fund.  CPT Capital is particularly significant because it has previously invested in several highly successful cultured meat startups. These include BluNalu, Memphis Meats, and Aleph Farms. CellulaREvolution was founded in 2019 with the aim of improving the efficiency of cultured meat production. It hopes to solve two of the most pressing problems faced by the industry — the need for animal-derived serum and the high cost of cell cultivation. To solve the first problem, CellulaREvolution is developing a synthetic peptide coating that makes animal serum unnecessary, reducing costs and making production more stable. To cut costs further, the company is working on a process called “continuous culturing”. It has developed bioreactors that allow the cells to grow constantly, increasing yields and requiring fewer inputs. While it’s still early days, preliminary data suggest that twice as many cells could be produced in a given time period, using a smaller bioreactor than conventional batch culturing. This has the potential to cut production costs significantly. Several companies are now making progress towards reducing the cost of cultured meat, which will be necessary to convince consumers to make the switch. In November, Indian company Clear Meat claimed it had achieved price parity with its lab-grown chicken mince. And earlier this month, Israeli company Future Meat Technologies reduced production costs by a thousand times when it produced a quarter pound of cultured chicken for $7.50. “Currently we have several ongoing collaborations with cultured meat companies where we are jointly testing their specific cell lines with our technology,” CellulaREvolution co-founder and CEO Leo Groenewegen told FoodNavigator. “Positive results have been shown so far and we are keen to move some of these collaborations to a sale.”    "
10063,Jim Mellon: “Governments Should Love This Industry: Particularly in Parts of the World that Rely on Food Imports.”,https://vegconomist.com/agriculture/jim-mellon-governments-should-love-this-industry-particularly-in-parts-of-the-world-that-rely-on-food-imports/,2021-02-11,"“An investor’s guide to the new agricultural revolution”, is the subtitle and topic of the book “Moo’s Law“. Author Jim Mellon is an investor and entrepreneur from the UK who, in this interview, told us about the book and how he envisions the future of our global food system.  The title of your book is a play on Moore’s Law. Could you explain this?
In 1965, Gordon Moore, the computer engineer who would go on to found Intel, noticed that semiconductors were getting twice as efficient every two years or so. “Moore’s Law” was his famous prediction that computers would continue to improve exponentially. He was right: computer chips nowadays are almost inconceivably more efficient than when he made the prediction. So I ‘riffed’ off the term for cellular agriculture because I noticed a similar trajectory for this industry. The main reason we’re not all eating cultured meat already is the price. In 2013, Professor Mark Post unveiled the world’s first “lab-grown burger” to journalists in London, in a project costing around €250,000 and funded by Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google. Mark went on to found Mosa Meat, where they can produce cultured beef patties for around €10 today. It’s astonishing how quickly the cost has tumbled. It’s still much more expensive than animal-derived meat, but you can see the downward trajectory  – hence “Moo’s Law”. You dedicated this book to your dog. Why did you decide to do so?
My dog Horatio died last year and, naturally, he was on my mind as I wrote Moo’s Law. As a pescatarian myself, I’m very concerned with animal welfare and finding more humane ways to feed ourselves. It made sense to dedicate the book to Horatio, who was so dear to me. Could you summarise your book and explain what you mean by the “new agrarian revolution”?
This book is all about the future of food. I explain why we need to radically transform our agricultural system, because the current intensive farming model is devastating to the environment, inflicts terrible cruelty on animals and risks damaging human health. What I call the “New Agrarian Revolution” is the collection of technology-based solutions that scientists and entrepreneurs are coming up with to fix our food supply. The first wave of innovation started with plant-based meat substitutes, like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, which have both become hugely popular. However, the second and larger wave of this revolution is cultivated meat, which is superior to animal-based meat in almost every way. It requires only a fraction of the land and water, results in only a fraction of the pollution, uses a negligible quantity of antibiotics and hormones, and does not require the slaughter of animals. This will be a revolutionary change not only in how we source our protein but also how we interact with the environment. What impact will in-vitro meat have on the food market?
It’s going to have a huge impact on the global food production system. Within the next ten years, cultivated products will be cheap enough to compete on the mass market, and eventually we will witness the displacement of intensive farming as a method of protein production. This will be transformational for the food supply and should have an instrumental impact in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions across the globe, as well as addressing animal welfare and offering consumers healthier and tastier food products. After the agrarian revolution, who will be the producers of clean meat?
As an investor in the field, I am backing the companies that have strong leadership, defensible intellectual property and know-how and are showing the greatest ability to scale-up production as they move towards commercialisation. In the book, I conceptualize how the field will play out in terms of three possibilities: fold, sold and bold. Some companies will inevitably fail (or “fold”) – that’s the nature of capitalism and early-stage investments. Others will sell out to the big food industry players like Nestle and Tyson, some of whom have VC arms already invested in the cellular agriculture space.  This is analogous to the biotech industry where large pharma companies are really distribution and marketing machines that acquire or “in-license” products and technologies. And some will be bold, or in other words become multibillion-dollar companies in their own right, in the same way Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat have done with plant-based meat analogues. It is these companies I believe will be the leading global producers of clean meat. You wrote that the production after the agrarian revolution will provide enough jobs to compensate for the loss in traditional agribusiness. What kind of education will be needed to work in the new agribusiness?
Yes, I was trying to rebut the claim made by the farming lobby that the shift to cellular agriculture will cause mass unemployment for farmers. I don’t think people realise how many agricultural jobs have already been lost over the last century or two. For most of human history, over 90% of the population was engaged in subsistence farming. Today, only 1% or 2% of Western populations work in agriculture. We have already eliminated the vast majority of agricultural jobs through technological innovation; mass unemployment did not ensue. I am simply advocating a further technological innovation that will make our food supply even more efficient. There will be opportunities in the new cellular agriculture industry for former farmworkers: tending the bioreactors and so on. They may require a certain amount of retraining but I don’t think it will be much more onerous or technical than working in any other type of factory. We also shouldn’t forget that huge swathes of land will be freed up for rewilding, recreation and housing, once we no longer need so much farmland. There will be wonderful employment opportunities in the new countryside. Personally, I would much rather be a park ranger than a farm labourer! Is it possible to cultivate other products than meat (for example, milk or eggs)?
Yes, it is. For example, there are a few companies creating cheese through cellular fermentation, such as LegenDairy Foods. Traditional vegan cheese doesn’t stretch or melt the same way as dairy cheese, because it lacks the key components such as casein, which is the “addictive” protein in dairy. But new cellular techniques will allow us to have dairy that looks and tastes the same as the traditional stuff, with none of the environmental or ethical downsides. Some companies are using “cellular aquaculture” to produce cell-based seafood. There’s one in San Diego called BlueNalu, which is scaling up very rapidly. They just raised US $60 million and plan to open a 40,000 square foot factory this year. And some of the most exciting products are in materials. There’s a great company called GALY which cultivates cotton. Traditional cotton is very water-intensive and thus susceptible to droughts – 10,000 litres of water is needed for one pair of jeans. Moreover, 6% of the world’s pesticides are used for cotton. If they can scale up successfully, it will be a huge achievement for the environment. How can the food industry prepare itself for the agrarian revolution?
I think a lot of the big players in the food industry are going to get involved in the New Agrarian Revolution. Some of them already have their own plant-based brands – e.g. Tyson Foods’ “Raised & Rooted” range and Purdue’s “Chicken Plus” range. And I expect many will acquire their competition in the cellular agriculture space once the technologies have been scaled up and derisked.  They will soon see the extraordinary returns are to be made there. Do you think traditional agribusiness will disappear in the future?
Arable farms will continue because we will still need crops, but I think traditional animal farming will become a small fraction of the industry today. At most there may be some hobby farms offering premium meat cuts – in the same way that there’s a demand for luxury Wagyu beef at the moment. What should the government do to support the agrarian revolution?
A smoother regulatory pathway is the most important action that governments can take. If one country delays approval for cultured products, it means that country will fall behind in attracting start-ups and investment. Governments should love this industry: particularly in parts of the world that rely on food imports (e.g. Britain, Singapore and the entire GCC region), it’s a great opportunity to become more self-sufficient. It will also provide many jobs in one of the most innovative sectors. Do you think clean meat products will be publicly accepted once they hit the market?
Yes, I think so. The three biggest factors for consumers are taste, price and convenience. Clean meat products will eventually be available in supermarkets, so convenience is not an issue. There is no difference in taste, and the price, as I’ve said, will soon reach parity with animal-derived meat. There is an effort by the agriculture industry to brand cultured products as some sort of “Frankenfoods”. I don’t think they’ll succeed, partly because the allegation is false, and partly because consumers are not too concerned with where their food comes from – you only have to look at the junk people eat at the moment. In the end, public acceptance will come down to convenience, price and taste. You write about the current legislation, regulation, companies, and investment. Will you update this part of the book for future reprints?
Yes, absolutely. When the time comes for a second edition, I will fully revise it to take account of all the latest developments. And on the book’s website, we have regular posts to keep readers up to date with the space. If you would like to hear Jim Mellon speak live about the topic, you can do so on 4 March. Jim will join scientists, CEOs and investors in cellular agriculture for the webinar “The Agrarian Revolution: Opportunities in Alternative Proteins” about the opportunities in the sector. The webinar has already taken place.    "
10064,The Rib-Eye Revolution: Aleph Farms and Technion Introduce First Cultured Thick Cut Steak,https://vegconomist.com/science/the-rib-eye-revolution-aleph-farms-and-technion-introduce-first-cultured-thick-cut-steak/,2021-02-11,"Israeli cultured meat pioneer Aleph Farms, and its research partner Technion, have cultivated their first slaughter-free thick cut ribeye steak, using 3D bioprinting technology and cow cells free from genetic engineering.  Back in 2018, vegconomist reported on Aleph Farms’ first commercial thin cut steak from cultured meat technology, and now in only two years, the company claims to have produced the world’s first cultured thick cut ribeye steak incorporating muscle and fat similar to its slaughtered counterpart. The company now reports to have the ability to produce any type of steak it wants, with plans to create a line of quality meat products using its patented bioprinting process. Unlike 3D printing technology, Aleph Farms’ 3D bioprinting technology involves printing live cells that are then incubated to grow, differentiate and interact in order to acquire the texture and qualities of a real steak. Using cellular agriculture in this way consumes a fraction of the resources, as well as being far less carbon-intensive and, of course, cruelty- and slaughter- free. Crucially, the process does without antibiotics, the overuse of which is a huge health threat from animal agriculture.   The Good Food Institute Israel recently revealed exceptionally strong growth in the plant-based sector in Israel, and reveals that the growth of the alternative protein market in 2020 was 13 times greater than that for animal products. Aleph Farms looks to be at the forefront of the cultivated meat revolution, with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu showing government support for the project by recently tasting the cultured meat and touring the facilities. “This breakthrough reflects an artistic expression of the scientific expertise of our team,” said Didier Toubia, Co-Founder and CEO of Aleph Farms. “I am blessed to work with some of the greatest people in this industry. We recognize some consumers will crave thicker and fattier cuts of meat. This accomplishment represents our commitment to meeting our consumer’s unique preferences and taste buds, and we will continue to progressively diversify our offerings.” “With the realization of this milestone, we have broken the barriers to introducing new levels of variety into the cultivated meat cuts we can now produce. As we look into the future of 3D bioprinting, the opportunities are endless,” said Technion Professor Shulamit Levenberg, Aleph’s Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Advisor.    "

10071,“Plant-Based Meat is a Rising and Unstoppable Trend in China” – HERO Protein Closes Pre-Seed Round,https://vegconomist.com/investments/plant-based-meat-is-a-rising-and-unstoppable-trend-in-china-hero-protein-closes-pre-seed-round/,2021-02-10,"Shanghai based alternative meat startup, HERO Protein, has closed a $850K pre-seed funding round, aiming to become the leading brand at the forefront of the plant-based revolution in China.   Claiming to be the first domestic Chinese company to use cutting-edge “high moisture extrusion” technology, HERO protein products are tailored to the Chinese market, a point that some Western alt-meat brands have missed while trying to gain traction in the country. The recent funding round saw investment from leading global corporates and restaurants, as well as Lever China Fund, the most active alternative protein investor in China. The funding round will be used to progress its ongoing research and development, to develop and scale production, and to expand distribution.   With a recent research study revealing that demand for plant-based meat in China and Thailand is expected to increase by 200% over the next five years, HERO Protein looks set to continue the development of its product range and market share. Its initial range includes a variety of plant-based beef and chicken products and was formulated by a team of former senior R&D executives from five of the largest plant-based meat brands in North America, namely Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, Gardein, Lightlife and Morningstar.  The investment will come as no surprise to anyone with an eye on the plant-based industry in China, a country with over 400 million millennials, the demographic most seen to have an active interest in plant-based foods. Major fast-food chain Dicos recently announced it is launching vegan chicken burgers, nuggets and egg products, after partnering with Shenzhen-based alt-meat brand Starfield, which in turn became China’s fastest-growing plant-based brand when it raised $10M.   “Plant-based meat is a rising and unstoppable trend in China. HERO Protein aims to bring together the advanced food technology used by top international players such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods and the domestic know-how to curate delicious products specifically catered to the Chinese palate, at prices affordable for a broader range of Chinese consumers. We are very pleased to receive support from investors and partners who share our mission,” said HERO Protein CEO Edward Weng.    "
10072,Is Fat Coming Back? UK Cultured Fat Startup Secures £2.7 Million,https://vegconomist.com/investments/is-fat-coming-back-uk-cultured-fat-startup-secures-2-7-million/,2021-02-10,"A taste revolution in the plant-based meat industry could be on the horizon as Hoxton Farms, the UK’s first cultured fat startup, has announced a £2.7 million seed round. Combining cell biology and mathematical modelling to make cruelty-free and sustainable fat, the company aims to replace conventional vegetable fats used by plant-based producers.  Up and coming cultured fat companies like Hoxton Farms have identified a problem that has existed in plant-based meat for decades: finding effective, low-cost and sustainable replacements for traditional animal fat. Often described as the most important sensory ingredient in meat, fat defines how meat looks, cooks, and tastes. Existing meat alternatives contain plant oils as a substitute for animal fat, but these oils can have a negative environmental impact, with many questions currently being raised about their effects on human health.  Starting from just a few cells, Hoxton Farms grows purified animal fat in bioreactors, using proprietary computational models to reduce the cost. “The Covid-19 crisis has exposed the fragility of traditional meat supply chains and the risks they pose to human health and the environment. We wanted to bring together our skills to address a pressing problem: how to satisfy a growing demand for meat without compromising on health, sustainability or animal ethics,” explains Ed Steele, co-founder of Hoxton Farms. Other players in the market include Belgian Peace of Meat, the B2B cultured fat supplier also developing a unique, proprietary, stem-cell-based technology to produce animal fats. Interestingly, Peace of Meat recently canvassed plant-based meat producers, with results showing that up to 68% of respondents would be likely or very likely to incorporate cultivated fat into their products. Meat-Tech 3D Ltd, a developer of industrial-scale cultivated meat production technologies based on advanced 3D bioprinting, has made an initial €1M investment into the company, as part of a planned full acquisition. Dr Max Jamilly, Co-Founder of Hoxton Farms, said: “We want to bring back fat: it’s the single most important ingredient in the meat that we eat. The technology we’re developing will allow us to customise fat for any application – and we’re making it healthier too. Cultivated fat is the hero ingredient for meat alternatives, and it will solve a huge problem in this growing industry. We believe the future of meat alternatives will be a blend of plant-based protein and cultivated fat.”    "
10082,"Impossible Foods Lowers Prices Once Again, This Time for Retail",https://vegconomist.com/food-and-beverage/impossible-foods-lowers-prices-once-again-this-time-for-retail/,2021-02-09,"Thanks to tremendous growth over the past months and years, Impossible Foods has now announced another price reduction of its alternative products, this time for US retailers. The company will reduce recommended prices in grocery shops and supermarkets across the USA by approximately 20%.  This is the first retail price cut since the launch of Impossible products, but it follows two other price cuts that have already taken place in the past year. Having already cut prices by 15% for foodservice providers, particularly restaurant retailers, Impossible recently cut them by a further 15%.  Some companies only cut prices when they have lower than expected sales. On the contrary, Impossible is lowering its prices amid record demand for its alternative protein products. The company’s goal is to lower prices through economies of scale, achieve price parity and then undercut the price of conventional ground beef. This current price reduction, as well as the other price reductions for restaurants, are possible because Impossible has been able to significantly increase sales of its products over the past few months. Just one year ago, the popular plant-based Impossible Burger was sold in only 150 grocery shops. It is now available in nearly 17,000 grocery shops nationwide – a more than 100-fold increase in 2020 alone. Thanks to rising demand, production costs are falling and Impossible Foods is passing these savings on to its network of distributors and retailers, with the ultimate goal of lowering prices for consumers. This in turn accelerates faster retail growth – a virtuous circle.    "

10110,Russia to Host its First Ever Plant-Based Incubator This Spring,https://vegconomist.com/startups/russia-to-host-its-first-ever-plant-based-incubator-this-spring/,2021-02-03,"Russia is soon to have its first-ever plant-based incubator as the ProVeg Incubator partners with the newly-formed Association of Alternative Food Producers (AAFPP), a non-profit that was set up in Russia by Julia Marsel and Tim Ponomarev, two of the founders of the ProVeg Incubator alumni startup Greenwise.  Greenwise is one of Russia’s first plant-based meat companies. The startup graduated from the ProVeg Incubator in 2019 and is now selling products at over 2,000 retailers around the world. The incubator, based in the Moscow and Kaluga region, will be ready for its first cohort of startups this spring. Participating entrepreneurs will be either based in Russia or the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), or focused on targeting those markets. AAFPP enthused on social media, “Today we officially announced a partnership between ProVeg Incubator and AAFPP! We were inspired by ProVeg International, an international non-profit organization aimed at changing the global food system by replacing traditional animal products with plant-based and cultivated alternatives. Together, the organisations will support and accelerate food and food-tech companies that are developing alternatives to animal-based products. This includes, for example, startups developing plant-based food or ingredients, cultured meat and seafood, or related tech products such as 3D bioprinting. Julia Marsel, Co-founder of the AAFPP and of Greenwise, said: “We started as a plant-based brand but, over the years, we’ve broadened the scope of our activities and now see ourselves as drivers of Russian food tech. In Russia, and other Russian-speaking regions, the alternative food market is still in its infancy and needs support. That’s why we decided to set up an organisation that, together with the ProVeg Incubator, will support startups and help to achieve our shared goal of a future food system that doesn’t rely on animal ingredients.” Albrecht Wolfmeyer, Head of the ProVeg Incubator, commented: “We are excited to be developing the market for animal-free food innovations in the Russian-speaking countries, together with the AAFPP. The potential impact of this project is enormous, given that the target region has a population of around 240 million people. We will bring our experience and know-how to the table, having already built a pioneering food incubator, and look forward to mentoring startup founders and connecting them to partners from Germany and beyond.”    "
10111,Israel: Growth of Alternative Protein was X13 Greater than Animal Products in 2020,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/israel-growth-of-alternative-protein-was-x13-greater-than-animal-products-in-2020/,2021-02-03,"The Good Food Institute (GFI) Israel recently provided new consumer market data with vegconomist which shows exceptionally strong growth in the alternative food sector in Israel, and reveals that the growth of the alternative protein market in 2020 was 13 times greater than that for animal products.  The latest market data was provided by Israeli market analyst StoreNext and shows extraordinary growth in demand and sales of alternative protein products in the Israeli food market. According to the data, the Israeli alternative protein market grew by 18.5% from 2019 to 2020, while the animal food market grew by only 1.8% (excluding the pandemic effect). Consumption of soy beverages increased by about 23% in 2020. Purchases of non-soy plant-based beverages (rice, oats, almonds) grew by 55 per cent. General demand for dairy alternatives to include cheese and yogurt, increased by a full 40 per cent. The biggest growth in the meat alternatives category was in plant-based burgers (McDonald’s launched a plant burger in Israel back in 2019) and plant-based minced meat, with an overall growth rate of 57%. The Israeli alternative meat market grew by about 24% overall from 2019 to 2020, mainly due to sales of the above products, followed by plant-based cutlets and sausages, especially in the last quarter of 2020. “Alternative dairy products currently account for 13% of the Israeli dairy market – exactly the same market share that dairy substitutes take in the US market,” says Aviv Oren, business engagement manager at GFI Israel. He expects this growth to continue as new technologies and major players enter this market.    "

The company has also secured $26.75 million in a new raise. The company, which secured $14 million Series A in October 2019, states its plans to market its products to consumers and restaurants within 18 months, and is currently seeking regulatory approval in various territories. Following the chicken product, FMT will develop cultured lamb kebabs and beef burgers. Its ability to produce cultured fat sets it apart with a distinct advantage as it will not have to rely on the use of saturated fats or palm oil or additives such as sodium. Prof. Yaakov Nahmias, founder and chief scientific officer of Future Meat Technologies, states; “It required massive efforts of biologists, chemists, engineers and food experts to reduce the cost of cultured meat by over 1,000-fold in just a few years. We are proud to be within reach of cost parity with traditional agriculture without any need to resort to genetic engineering, ensuring the supply of safe, delicious food for coming generations.” “Cost-efficient production has been a critical focus area for the cultured meat industry. This development is a major step forward in Future Meat Technologies’ ability to provide affordable, scalable and sustainable products that can meet the growing demand for meat,” said Rom Kshuk, chief executive officer of Future Meat Technologies.

Let’s not forget the kids’ table. Dandies vegan marshmallows made by the Chicago Food Company heads to the U.K. with their sweet treat. Dandies is known for their vegan marshmallows which do not include animal products. My business bottom line is this: Items like gelatin found on ingredients lists are becoming a problem for educated consumers which not only read the labels, but they also look at each ingredient and decide if it is for them. This also includes children whom, last time we checked, said they didn’t want to see their animal friends ground up in their candy. More sweet news coming from Eat Just, the global plant-based liquid egg company, which is also known for its cultivated meat which was regulated by the country of Singapore last fall. They have joined forces with Cuisine Solutions, a sous vide food company. Together the two will make Eat Just Egg Sous Vide Bites and they will soon be available in four global flavors in the frozen food section. My business bottom line is this: The egg industry takes it on the face as they get competition from Israel with Zero Egg, India with Evo Foods, globally with Eat Just, and newcomer Grace O’Brien gives them competition coming out of California with Peggs.

I believe our microextrusion technology can unlock the potential of whole-cut alternative protein products,” Scionti told vegconomist Español. In December, a Korean research center published what was believed to be the largest scaffold to support cultured meat applications. Giuseppe Scionti calculated the volume of the Korean prototype at 17000mm3, which NovaMeat has managed to surpass, making it the largest in the world. NovaMeat also informed us that it will hold an investment round in the coming months, with the aim of expanding its technology beyond 3D printing. The goal is to reach a production speed of 100kg/h. This month vegconomist Español reported that the Spanish government invested €250,000 in Nova Meat, which came from the NEOTEC program of the CDTI (Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnológico Industrial). Acacia Smith, policy director at the Good Food Institute Europe, said, “This significant investment will put Spain at the forefront of plant-based meat in Europe and help facilitate the transition to a healthier and more sustainable food system, reducing prices and making these products available to all. “Governments interested in meeting their climate change goals, protecting public health and increasing food security should follow Spain’s lead and invest in making plant-based meat delicious, affordable and convenient across Europe.”    "

MIRAI says it is one of the very few cultured meat producers globally that do not genetically manipulate their cells. Backers include Paulig Group and technology investor Team Europe.  Despite being only one year in operation, MIRAI is now accelerating product development of its slaughter-free meat and working on releasing its first commercial product. The company has three main areas of focus: bringing cellular agriculture products to the market as quickly and safely as possible; providing better value for its customers; and designing products which offer superior health benefits in comparison to traditional meat products. A founding principle of MIRAI as a cultured meat producer is that it keeps the cells as they naturally occur in the animal, with no genetic modification used in the process. Whilst the company aims to produce a variety of product lines to maximize the impact of cellular agriculture on environmental goals, its first product will be beef, as it has the biggest carbon footprint. “We are proud to have such high-calibre and diverse investors on board,” says Christoph Mayr, MIRAI FOODS co-founder and CEO. “The Paulig Group, with its extensive experience in the food industry, is an ideal partner for product development, marketing and distribution. Team Europe has an impressive track record as an investor and company builder. Like us, they are interested in getting cultured meat into the hands of consumers in a timely manner.” “MIRAI FOODS is a second-generation player in this field and they have been extremely fast”, says Marika King, Head of Paulig’s venture arm PINC. “It only took them six months to develop the first prototype and we are very excited to be part of this team’s journey.

But in 2018, the company made a surprising announcement — it would be donating some of its products to clean meat startup SuperMeat.  Although it is primarily a meat company, Soglowek launched a vegetarian line called Zoglo’s back in 1987. Most of the products contained egg, and so were not vegan. Then, in 2018, Soglowek introduced a fully plant-based line under the Zoglo’s brand. At the same time, it made the surprising announcement that 20 percent of profits from the line would be donated to SuperMeat, an Israeli company working on lab-grown meat. SuperMeat’s logo would even appear on the product packaging. While the news is surprising, Soglowek isn’t the first meat company to invest in alt-meat products. US meat producer Tyson Foods has now launched multiple plant-based products, while Canadian company Maple Leaf Foods has also established a plant-based brand. “I was born to a family of butchers, spending time in slaughterhouses since the age of 5,” Soglowek CEO Eli Soglowek told GFI. “Despite that, I love dogs, horses, and also cows very much and would like to transition to eating cultured meat that is produced by machines using stem cells taken from real animals without causing harm to the animals and without polluting the planet. I would like to invest time and money to do to the meat industry what Elon Musk is doing to the automobile industry.”    "

10192,Spanish Government to Invest €5.2M in Cultured Meat Project Led by BioTech Foods,https://vegconomist.com/science/spanish-government-to-invest-e5-2m-in-cultured-meat-project-led-by-biotech-foods/,2021-01-19,"The GFI recently said that a ‘new space race for the future of food’ had begun and that regulation for cultured meat in Europe is expected to follow soon behind Singapore. Spain’s BioTech Foods today reveals a €5.2 million R&D initiative called the CULTUREDMEAT project, after receiving funding from the EU last October. The general objective of the CULTUREDMEAT project is to investigate meat produced from cellular agriculture, with BioTech Foods from the Basque country as technological leaders, along with 7 other entities and 10 research organizations including leading animal meat manufacturers Argal and Martínez Somalo. BioTech Foods has been producing its own cell-based brand called Ethicameat since 2017, a range of cultured meat products which are high in protein, fat-free, slaughter-free and antibiotic-free.  The Spanish Ministry of Science has granted the project €3.7 million to develop cultured meat, and together with the development of healthy fats and functional ingredients, they will enable healthier meat products to be made than traditional red meat. One of the ultimate aims of the project is to reduce the rates of colon cancer and high cholesterol, two of Spain’s most fatal health problems. The total budget of the initiative will amount to €5.2 million. “The biggest challenge for the sector at the moment is the industrial scale that allows producing sufficient volumes for commercialization. The production of cultivated meat has aroused great interest in the industry and many players are working on this meat of the future that reduces the environmental impact and protects the welfare of the animals,” said BioTech Foods about the project.

10239,The VegTech Sector is Proving That Animal-Based Meat & Dairy May Soon be Obsolete,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/the-vegtech-sector-is-proving-that-animal-based-meat-dairy-may-soon-be-obsolete/,2021-01-11,"Twenty years ago, you would be lucky to walk into the supermarket and find soymilk on the shelf. If you spotted the bleak rectangle shelf-stable box it was a banner day. But as we are witnessing, VegTech has entered the market in such a big way that the end of animal-based products may well be in sight, reports Anna Keeve.  The same was true for veggie burgers: the underwhelming selection of bean or soy-based patties didn’t leave much to be desired, and no chance you were bringing those to a BBQ in an attempt to woo your meat-loving friends.  A lot has changed in the last few decades. Plant-based foods have reached an inflection point. There is growth in nearly every plant-based food category, and it’s estimated that 25 percent of the US population is opting for these vegan-friendly alternatives over their animal-based counterparts. One of the key reasons for the mass acceleration of plant-based products—especially plant-based proteins—is food technology.  This emerging sector of plant-based food technology is so significant and represents an industry of epidemic proportion, it exhorts its own industry category: enter “VegTech” (a term I coined earlier this year on the Plant Based Business Hour podcast and Facebook Live show). VegTech companies are food technology companies creating plant-based meat or dairy products. At their core, VegTech companies are hyper-focused on creating foods that are not substitutes or alternatives, but replacements for animal-based foods; a defining characteristic is their intent to make products that are nearly indistinguishable from animal-based natives.  VegTech companies are often built like software companies, with Chief Technology Officers (CTO) at the helm of product development; they establish locales in tech-hub cities; emulate tech-centric product development cycles, and garner big-tech money. As more companies enter the VegTech sector and attract mammoth investments, the plant-based food evolution—and revolution—is impending. VegTech companies are helping usher in a new era of plant-driven foods that appeal to the masses.  For the everyday shopper, technological food innovation means better tasting products, available more places—retail, food service, and even direct-to-consumer online—and at a price point that will rival, and will eventually be lower than, animal-based counterpart products. People, and the planet, have a lot to gain from this emerging sector, as we are just beginning to ascertain the potential of what will be one of the most influential industry sectors in modern history.  When you think about a VegTech company, you might imagine people in lab coats, hovering over a petri dish, growing food in a lab—it’s far less science-fiction looking, at least for now. Josh Nixon, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Prime Roots, a Bay-area startup focused on innovation in the plant-based protein space, explains that technology as it relates to food often has to do with ingredient innovation. Having a goal of where you want to end up, a certain taste and texture, and taking a novel ingredient to reach that goal. Prime Roots for example is using an ingredient called Koji to create plant-based meat products that are on the market today. “Koji has not been used before to create texture and primary protein,” says Nixon. “We’ve taken this 8,000 year-old Japanese superfood and repurposed it, and are using it in a new way.” Nixon says that production looks more like a brewery and a kitchen than a science lab, and their innovation takes a form that is “a little more grounded to earth in solving problems this century.”  There’s a growing number of examples of food companies with technologists like Nixon at the helm. SIMULATE (formerly Nuggs) is another. Founded by tech entrepreneur Ben Pasternak, and a key hire Thierry Saint-Denis, the former senior director of research and innovation at Danone, is now Nuggs’ CTO. The company’s keystone product is “chicken” nuggets—you’ve likely seen their ads grace your Instagram feed. As the “Tesla of chicken,” the company says it utilizes “advanced soy protein technology that enables a hyper-realistic simulation of the texture and flavor of an animal-based nugget.” And currently, Pasternak and his company are working on 2.0 of their nuggets. Bay area-based Eclipse ice cream prides itself on an ice cream that it says is indistinguishable from dairy ice cream. “While our ice cream was created in a kitchen, not a lab, we’ve discovered a blend of plants and a revolutionary process that allows us to unlock the magic of milk in a plant-based milk,” says Eclipse Foods CEO and Co-Founder Aylon Steinhart. “We are able to create indistinguishable dairy products from plants because we’ve discovered microscopic structures called micelles that allow dairy milk to turn from liquid (milk) to semi-solid (cream) to solid (cheese).” Recreating these micelles in their milk enables them to create a plant-based, non-GMO ice cream doppelgänger. Their ice creams are also equivalent to dairy products in terms of protein and calcium, but are allergen-free, and have almost no cholesterol or saturated fat found in conventional dairy.  Some of the established plant-based players in the VegTech space include JUST Inc., known best for their JUST Egg product. They manipulate mung beans to make a spitting image of an egg. And of course, there are household names like Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND), one of the first modern-day VegTech companies, founded in 2009. They use technology to transform pea protein into meat-like burgers, meatballs and more. Their constant innovation is leading to better-tasting beef replacements, a better nutritional profile, and lower cost for the consumer. Impossible Foods is another, and perhaps epitomizes a VegTech company. Their innovation comes in the form of a molecule called heme—a component of an oxygen-carrying molecule also present in blood—that gives meat a meat-like smell and look. Using a heme-containing protein naturally found in plants, Impossible Foods makes a burger that looks, tastes, and is even so close to the real thing, most people would never guess it’s all vegetables. Based in Silicon Valley, on the surface Impossible Foods looks more like a tech company than a food company. And the company’s latest product, Impossible Sausage and Impossible Pork, debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2020. Yes, a technology show, not a food show. Impossible continues to pull in monster investments, raising nearly $1.3 billion since its founding in 2011. Not all VegTech companies are created equal. And some question whether the hype of some technology matches up with reality. This is specifically true when it comes to cellular agriculture (often called “cell ag,” and when referring to proteins specifically, “cultured meat” or “clean meat” or “lab-grown meat”). While the aforementioned companies all have products on the market now, cell ag is in its infancy. This food technology, that may in fact be a little less grounded to earth, aims to make indistinguishable animal-like foods…without the animals.  While heralded as a technology that will revolutionize food and eliminate environmentally destructive animal agriculture, no cell ag-made products have reached the market yet. Many questions remain including high costs of development, regulatory and health concerns, plus people’s psychological acceptance. A study from the University of Sydney and Curtin University found that 72 percent of Generation Z (individuals born between 1995 and 2002) would not be interested in eating lab-grown meat, even if it means eliminating the need to slaughter animals. Despite this, big money is being poured into the space.  One cell ag company, Memphis Meat, which has attracted high-profile investors like Bill Gates, Richard Branson and meat giants Cargill and Tyson Foods, “cautioned the industry around releasing a product too soon, stressing the need to make it right, or risk tarnishing the image of the industry for years,” according to an interview with MarketWatch. The company has though demonstrated their proof of concept, making cultured chicken nuggets and beef meatballs, as well as duck tissue. BlueNalu in San Diego, Calif, has also demonstrated it can make fish meat from fish cells (obtained typically by swabbing skin tissue). The living cells are isolated and placed into a solution to proliferate. The end product is a fleshy tissue that is biologically identical to meat. The company demoed its bluefin tuna fish meat last year.  A question also remains as to whether or not cultured meat is vegan; it might depend on how cells are obtained. While no animals are slaughtered to make lab-grown meat, the cells needed to make the “meat” product still need to come from animals.  Fermentation is a lesser known, but highly important, pillar of plant-based food innovation and the VegTech sector. Fermentation uses microbial species to produce or transform a food product or ingredient. Heme is a fermented ingredient for example, and serves a key component of Impossible Foods’ “bleeding” burger. Fermentation can be harnessed to produce both enablers for plant-based and cultivated meat, eggs, and dairy, or as a primary protein source.  Fermentation technology is already delivering next-gen sustainable and efficiently produced plant-based meat and dairy products with more on the way. In 2019 fermentation companies raised 3.5 times more capital than cultivated meat companies worldwide and almost 60 percent as much as US plant-based meat, egg, and dairy companies according to Good Food Institute research.  The fermentation industry’s largest ever raise, was plant-based dairy company Perfect Day’s $300 million Series C. Perfect Day uses microflora (a microorganism such as bacteria, yeast, or in their case, fungi) to make proteins since microflora are particularly good at producing animal proteins. They use fermentation tanks to grow flora to eventually develop milk proteins that serve as the basis of their vegan dairy products like ice cream and cheese. “We use fermentation to make the foods people love while delivering the same taste, texture, and nutrition as conventional dairy without the environmental, food safety, or welfare concerns,” says Perfect Day CEO and Co-founder Ryan Pandya. “But that’s just the start. By working with food and dairy companies to bring a new category of animal-free products to market, we’re building a next-generation supply chain to provide more nutritious, scalable options globally.” Fermentation shows promise for the potential of greater scale, lower cost, improved efficiency, and enhanced sustainability. “The opportunity landscape for technology development is completely untapped in this area,” says Good Food Institute (GFI) Associate Director of Science and Technology Dr. Liz Specht. “Many alternative protein products of the future will harness the plethora of protein production methods now available, with the option of leveraging combinations of proteins derived from plants, animal cell culture, and microbial fermentation.” What the current product-in-market VegTech companies have done well—and continue to improve on—is tackling the three factors critical to ushering in plant-based food adoption: availability, price and taste. As these companies scale, availability increases, price goes down and taste gets better.  “We think like a scientist, act like a technologist, but make food like a chef,” says Prime Roots Co-founder Joshua Nixon, reminding that while technology is critical, a chef-centric approach is important in putting forward desirable foods. “But technology is what makes the difference on taste and quality. When we create these delicious products, it becomes simpler to gain wide adoption and scale. If a sceptic has just one taste, they’ll have an epiphany. And if they haven’t had that epiphany, they haven’t tried a technology-enabled plant-based product.”   This piece was contributed by Anna Keeve, a freelance writer covering the plant-based sector.

10250,"Vow Foods, Producer of Cultivated Exotic Meats Such as Kangaroo, Secures $6M",https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/vow-foods-producer-of-cultivated-exotic-meats-such-as-kangaroo-secures-6m/,2021-01-08,"Australian cultured meat startup Vow Foods, producer of traditional meats as well as more obscure meats like kangaroo, alpaca and water buffalo, recently announced the closing of an oversubscribed $6 million seed, to  further research and develop its cultured meat products to surpass conventional meat in quality and taste.  Vow Foods, as we reported in September, was founded in 2019 in Sydney, with a focus not only on more unusual species but also on a more ethical production without animal suffering. Its vision is to create new meat options that are intended to be healthier than conventional meat products. In 2019, Vow unveiled the world’s first cultured kangaroo meat, becoming the first company in the world to grow a food product from the cells of a non-domesticated animal. Since then, Vow has expanded its portfolio to include 11 different species, specializing primarily in exotic animal meats. With the upcoming completion of its state-of-the-art food design studio and laboratory in Sydney, Vow is positioning itself as the best company to work for in the cultured meat industry. New employees from top universities, the high-tech industry and even other cultured meat startups are joining Vow. As a result, the young company has grown its team from five to 22 in less than a year. “We’ve had a strong focus on culture and individual personal development, and this has been one of the best investments we’ve ever made,” says Dr. James Ryall, Vow’s chief scientific officer. “There is no doubt that cultured meat will soon be available and mainstream everywhere, as was evident earlier this month with the world’s first cultured meat product approved for sale in Singapore,” said George Peppou, co-founder and chief executive officer of Vow. “It’s about so much more than an alternative to animal agriculture, it’s about a product category that is completely different and better than what animals can produce.” The current seed round was led by Square Peg Capital. Also participating in the round were existing investors Blackbird Ventures and Grok Ventures (the investment office of Mike and Annie Cannon-Brookes), as well as new investor Tenacious Ventures. This round also brings Square Peg’s James Tynan to Vow’s board. “In Vow, we’ve found a team that has a bold vision for the future of food. They are tackling one of the biggest problems on the planet and have achieved better results with less than 1 percent of the resource consumption of their competitors,” commented Tynan. “We are thrilled to be able to help them achieve that vision.”    "
10251,USA: Air Protein Announces $32 Million Series A Financing,https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/usa-air-protein-announces-32-million-series-a-financing/,2021-01-08,"Air Protein, a pioneer in the production of meat from elements of the air, today announce the closing of a $32 million Series A round. Led by founder and CEO Dr. Lisa Dyson, Air Protein will use the funding to launch an innovative R&D lab, accelerate product development and commercialization, and build a world-class team.  Air Protein was inspired by Dr. Dyson’s mission to build a modern meat company to introduce nutrient-rich, ultra-sustainable, alternative proteins that can sustainably feed the world’s growing population. The Series A is led by ADM Ventures, Barclays and GV (formerly Google Ventures). Founded in 2019, Air Protein makes meat from elements in the air to sustainably feed the population in the future.

10256,"NOVAMEAT Gets Funding From Spanish Government, Launches Whole-Cuts into No.9 World’s Best Restaurant",https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/novameat-gets-funding-from-spanish-government-launches-whole-cuts-into-no-9-worlds-best-restaurant/,2021-01-07,"Barcelona-based NOVAMEAT, known for 3D printing the world’s most realistic steak and pork, announces that it has secured $250,000 (approximately $300,000) from the Government of Spain. Meanwhile, its whole cuts of plant meat are to debut in double Michelin star restaurant Disfrutar.  The foodtech startup uses innovative technology to structure a variety of proteins. This allows the production of meat of vegetable origin with a fibrous texture, which also imitates the appearance of the meat, in addition to its sensory properties, particularly the taste. Currently, the meat substitute industry has managed to imitate chicken pieces, tuna flakes and, most of all, ground meats, with some precision. However, replicating whole pieces of meat, such as steaks or pork fillets, remains a challenge. This implies that there may be a large market for potential consumers of whole plant based meats. “With this investment we will be able to accelerate the launch of our technology and scale beyond 3D printers to produce thousands of kilograms of whole plant meat cuts per hour, with industrial machines based on microextrusion,” says Alexandre Campos, director of business development at NovaMeat. NOVAMEAT also announces its new collaboration with two-Michelin starred restaurant “Disfrutar”, recently named no.9 on The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list. The restaurant is run by Oriol Castro, Mateu Casañas and Eduard Xatruch, all of whom were part of the legendary creative culinary team at El Bulli restaurant, before it closed in 2011. Dr. Giuseppe Scionti, NOVAMEAT’s founder and CEO, ethuses: “If we want to create a quick transition towards a sustainable and ethical food supply system, plant-based meats cannot be only as good as their animal counterparts, they must deliver superior sensorial experience and nutritional benefits. For the consumers, the fact that they are better for the environment and animal welfare reasons should be a plus. To set the benchmark in the alternative proteins industry, we decided to work together with top chefs, and the Barcelona area has some of the greatest. I have seen plant-based meats reaching a few Michelin-starred restaurants lately, but I have never seen one of the world’s top 10 working on it, this is a first-time ever. It is a privilege to work alongside Eduard, Oriol and Mateu: what they did at El Bulli and are doing now at Disfrutar is simply incredible. This is the second time that the Spanish government has invested in a vegan food producer. In January 2020, the same CDTI NEOTEC program announced that it was investing in the Spanish company Heura Foods, which has had great success with its vegan products in Europe and the United Kingdom.

10266,Aleph Farms and Mitsubishi Bring Cultivated Meat to Japan,https://vegconomist.com/food-and-beverage/aleph-farms-and-mitsubishi-bring-cultivated-meat-to-japan/,2021-01-06,"Aleph Farms, Ltd, the Israel-based foodtech startup which revealed its cultivated steak for market in November; was able to “grow steak” in space; and gave a taste of cultivated meat to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month – now announces a signed MoU with Mitsubishi to bring cultivated meat to the Japanese table.  Mitsubishi Corporation will provide its expertise in biotechnology processes, branded food manufacturing, and local distribution channels in Japan. Aleph Farms will provide its proven, scalable manufacturing platform (BioFarm™) for cultivation of whole-muscle steaks.  “The MoU with Mitsubishi Corporation’s Food Industry Group marks an important milestone for us, as we methodically build the foundations of our global go-to-market activities with selected partners,” notes Didier Toubia, Co-Founder and CEO of Aleph Farms. Mitsubishi Corporation is a global integrated business enterprise that develops and operates a global network of 1,700 group companies in 90 countries. With yearly revenue of US$140B, Mitsubishi Corporation is comprised of 10 Business Groups covering virtually every industry. The Food Industry Group covers food resources, fresh foods, consumer products, and food ingredients, and is active in every link of the food supply chain, from the production and sourcing of raw materials to the manufacturing of finished food products. “The cooperation demonstrates Aleph Farms’ strategy of working together with the food and meat industries to ensure a successful integration of cultivated meat within the ecosystem, while maximizing the positive impact we make,” adds Toubia. “We are excited to bring cultivated meat production closer to the Japanese market.” This cooperation takes a lead role in the fight against climate change, especially now that the Japanese government stipulated a goal of achieving zero greenhouse gas emissions. In April 2020, Aleph Farms committed to eliminating emissions associated with its meat production by 2025 and reach the same net-zero emissions across its entire supply chain by 2030. As the demand for meat continues to rise with evolving lifestyles, the cooperation will also provide actionable solutions to overcome the societal challenges to the local population surrounding the domestic meat supply. This includes implementing stable food channels of quality nutrition. “This is part of a network of ‘BioFarm to Fork’ strategic partnerships being developed by Aleph Farms in APAC, LATAM, and Europe, following the successful 2019 Round-A strategic investment by Cargill and the Migros Group in Switzerland,” reports Gary Brenner, VP of Market Development at Aleph Farms. Aleph Farms and Mitsubishi Corporation are members of the “Cellular Agriculture Study Group”, a consortium implementing policy proposals under the Japanese Center for Rule-Making Strategy. The consortium brings together a range of experts on the definition and construction of cellular agricultural foods. It also adds clarification of conditions for Japanese products and technologies to have international competitiveness and establishes mechanisms for coexistence and division of roles with existing industries.

The GFI calls for more government investment to ensure cultivated meat can be produced in volumes that will move it from being a niche product to being available in restaurants worldwide. “This is a powerful sign of our progress on the journey to a new future for meat,” said Friedrich. “The world-first sale and serving of cultivated meat demonstrates the feasibility of this technology, and the Singapore government is doing all it can to advance this better way of making meat. “This is a big step forward, but bringing cultivated meat to the masses will require significantly more government investment. Just like governments support renewable energy and vaccine development, governments should be funding open-access cultivated meat science and innovation. The more that happens, the quicker we’ll see cultivated meat produced at volumes that will enable it to be sold in every restaurant in the world.” Friedrich said.  “We hope this sets off a global space-race level response from governments. Shifting away from industrial animal agriculture and toward plant-based and cultivated meat represents one of humanity’s most promising solutions for tackling climate change. Singapore and Israel are leading the way on this transition and China, the EU, and the United States need to catch up,” he added. “This is a tremendous time for alternative proteins, when two nations have publicly thrown their support behind cultivated meat. Last week, Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu ate cultivated meat and declared that Israel would be a global leader on alternative proteins. Now, Singapore is the first country where cultivated meat is being sold. This is a very big deal for the future of meat production globally.”    "

Co-founded by Claire Smith, established vegan impact investor and initiator of the Beyond Investing cruelty-free indexes, and Dhanesh Kothari, blockchain expert advisor and technologist at leading private banks, Beyond Animal has developed a suite of online services to businesses and professionals engaged in the transition away from the use of animals, including networking, a business directory, jobs board, event management, real-time news feed and knowledge library. Gill comments on his appointment, “I am ecstatic and honored to become CEO for Beyond Animal as I believe a FinTech and vegan all-in-one-place platform is the optimum way forward. I relish the challenges that I will no doubt encounter and will build upon the experience I have gained as a previous CEO within the vegan industry, which I am passionate about. By applying my management experience, unparalleled vision, business acumen and thirst for improving sustainability for the planet, I will boost Beyond Animal’s mission bringing it to the forefront of the growing animal-free industry.” Claire Smith remarks, “As a leading protagonist behind the explosive growth in plant-based products, George is well aware that investment in alternative proteins and animal-replacing food tech needs to extend way beyond mission-driven investors. Together we aim to ensure that no company whose products move us towards a more sustainable world is starved of financing and no investor that wants to profit from this shift in consumption is unable to find suitable deals.”    "
10320,Eat Just’s Cultured Chicken Launches this Saturday in First Sale of Cultured Meat,https://vegconomist.com/food-and-beverage/eat-justs-cultured-chicken-launches-this-saturday-in-first-sale-of-cultured-meat/,2020-12-16," The dishes will be prepared by 1880 Executive Chef Colin Buchan, former private chef to David and Victoria Beckham. Eat Just states it is proud that the first diners will be young people age 14-18 who have shown a commitment to building a better planet.  Says Eat Just Founder Josh Tetrick: “This historic step, the first-ever commercial sale of cultured meat, moves us closer to a world where the majority of meat we eat will not require tearing down a single forest, displacing a single animal’s habitat or using a single drop of antibiotics. “We’re thrilled to partner with 1880 to launch a product that will someday be served on the dinner tables of families living in the suburbs of Birmingham, Alabama, to the skyscrapers of Shanghai,” he added. “We are honored to host the global launch of Eat Just’s first cultured meat product. This is a revolutionary step towards solving climate change and creating the opportunity to feed the world without overwhelming the planet,” said 1880 Founder Marc Nicholson.    "
10321,ProVeg: 11 Reasons Why the Plant Sector Has Triumphed in the Year of the Pandemic,https://vegconomist.com/society/proveg-11-reasons-why-the-plant-sector-has-triumphed-in-the-year-of-the-pandemic/,2020-12-16,"ProVeg, the international organisation promoting a plant-based lifestyle worldwide, has published a report that gives 11 reasons why the plant-based food sector has been so successful in a year when many companies have suffered as a result of the global health crisis.  “This has been the year in which many food industry giants have decided to take the plant-based sector seriously and that is no coincidence”, says Cristina Rodrigo, Director of ProVeg Spain. “Any idea that vegetable choices were just a fleeting trend in the kitchen or a fad that consumers were going to turn their backs on when things got tough has been completely eliminated by everything that has happened in the last twelve months”. The following is ProVeg’s chosen list of eleven highlights that tell the story of this dynamic and innovative sector in 2020 (Naturally, the vegconomist team considers the number eleven among the most exciting…) The year was full of important product launches in major companies: Danet brought out its vegan custard, Findus presented its Green Cuisine range, Garden Gourmet launched Vuna (a vegetable alternative to tuna); Lidl expanded its range of vegetable meats, incorporated new ready-made dishes and included the vegetable cheese Vegan Feel, manufactured by García Baquero. Ikea also completed its dining room and take away offer with meatballs, Campofrío was launched with a 100% vegetable burger, Maheso launched its vegetable range Green Moments; in Aldi, we can already find the Wonder Burger and in Papa Johns, the vegetable pizza. At Rodilla they already have a 100% pasta salad which includes tofu. And, as if that were not enough, after the Rebel Whopper in 2019, this year Burger King extended its range in Spain with 100% vegetable nuggets. When is a hamburger not a hamburger, and can it legitimately be called “sausage” if it is made from plants? This year the European Parliament voted on two amendments to ban terms such as “veggie burgers” and “yogurt alternative”. However, thanks to the efforts of organisations such as ProVeg, MEPs voted against the proposed ban on the terms for alternatives to meat. This is an important decision (in Spain supported by the meat industry) which protects the future of the plant-based sector and ensures that European consumers can continue to buy alternatives to meat in an intuitive and everyday way. However, in the case of alternatives to dairy, the battle continues. Despite voting against a ban on the designation of vegetable-based burgers, MEPs supported further restrictions on the terms of dairy alternatives. All eyes are now on the EU’s national governments, who will have the opportunity to oppose the new restrictions during the negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy in early 2021. The world’s largest fast-food chain is finally starting to adopt plant-based alternatives. After trials in several markets, McDonald’s revealed in November that it plans to launch a plant-based burger in 2021. This could be followed by additional vegetable products, including alternatives to chicken. Other fast-food chains have also taken the plant-based sector seriously in 2020. Burger King partnered with Unilever’s Vegetarian Butcher brand to launch the ‘Rebel Whopper’ in the UK, as well as plant-based pies and nuggets in the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany. KFC Canada made its vegan ‘chicken’ sandwich a permanent menu item, while Pizza Hut made its vegan pizza a permanent menu item. The pandemic has been a historic moment for the plant-based product sector. With health and sustainability in the spotlight, and well-documented outbreaks of coronaviruses occurring in meat factories, consumer interest in plant-based options has accelerated. As expected, investor interest has also grown, allowing Impossible Foods to raise a staggering $500 million in March in the midst of the coronavirus crisis, accelerating its growth plans and boosting distribution. But Impossible Foods has not been alone. Across the industry, venture capital investments in plant proteins reached $1.1 billion through June alone, making 2020 a decisive year for plant-based market capitalisation, according to figures from the FAIRR network of investors. In November, Unilever committed to a sales target of $1 billion by 2027, which would mean five times the growth in the next seven years. It was one of several multinationals to set ambitious targets for sales of plant-based products. In September, Tesco, the UK’s largest supermarket chain, unveiled plans to increase sales of meat alternatives by 300% by 2025. The retailer also committed to improving the affordability of plant-based options. Oat milk has been the undisputed star of the plant-based sector in 2020. Thanks to its long shelf life and lack of refrigeration, it became a favourite with buyers during the pandemic. In the United States, demand was so high in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak that it exceeded the demand for hand sanitizer. By October, oats had overtaken soy to become the number two ingredient in US dairy alternatives (with almond milk in the first place). Oat-based products have also taken off elsewhere: Oatly established operations in Singapore to meet growing demand in Asia, while retail sales of oat-based products in the UK have almost doubled year-on-year. Oats also appeared in dozens of new product launches, with Califia, Arla, Starbucks and Nestlé among the brands that have expanded their ranges with new oat-based options this year. 2020 was the year when some of the world’s leading confectionery manufacturers began to pay close attention to the plant sector. In August, Lindt announced plans to launch a range of oat-based chocolate for the German market, while manufacturer Barry Callebaut announced a range of chocolate made with plants to meet growing consumer demand for dairy-free confectionery options. In Spain, Pink Albatross, Spain’s leading 100% vegan ice cream brand, closed its first round of financing with 550,000 Euros from Katjesgreenfood. In addition, Vclub, an Italian vegetable ice cream brand, reached the Consum and Aldi shelves. Cultured meat has also made great strides in 2020. The year began with some great news: In January, Memphis Meats revealed it had secured $161 million in funding (its largest ever) to build a production facility, paving the way for a commercial deployment. In June, KFC announced its partnership with a Russian 3D bio-printing company to create cultured chicken nuggets; and in November, Israel’s SuperMeat opened The Chicken in Tel Aviv, a restaurant serving cultured chicken products to diners. In addition, by 2020 Singapore has become the first country in the world to approve the sale of cultured meat. The demand for products has soared in China in the wake of the pandemic. Beyond Meat responded quickly and announced plans to build a new production plant near Shanghai. The investment marks the company’s biggest push in the Asian country to date. Production will begin in early 2021. It is not difficult to understand why global companies like Beyond Meat want to expand their presence in China. The country accounts for 27% of global meat consumption, according to Bloomberg, so the potential for alternatives to meat is huge. As such, local players are already stepping up their efforts. In April, Chinese food technology company Starfield partnered with six restaurant chains. In September, Green Monday Holdings, the company behind OmniPork, the pork alternative, secured $70 million to expand its plant-based portfolio, while Dao Foods International announced plans to invest in 30 new companies to accelerate China’s plant-based sector. Another of the milestones of the year was the agreement of the Pompeu Fabra University with the Menu for the Planet project, to offer a complete 100% vegetable menu every day in its dining room. Menú Por El Planeta, in collaboration with ProVeg Spain, is calling for the offer in the campus canteens to include a daily first course, a second course and a dessert of 100% vegetable origin as a measure of sustainability, ethics and health, at a price equal to or lower than the usual menu, so as not to pose any obstacles or financial difficulties for people who want to curb the climate crisis through their food. Menu for the Planet continues to collect signatures so that the initiative that the Pompeu Fabra University has already joined can be extended to the rest of the universities. Vegconomist, a globally relevant medium for the plant-based sector, was launched in Spain in mid-September. To date the Spanish platform has had around 12,000 unique visitors, most of whom have come from Spain, Mexico, the United States and Chile. The original vegconomist was launched in Berlin in 2018 by Peter Link, an expert in the field of journalism, public relations and marketing, followed by the English language Global version the same summer. The digital magazine, which specializes in economic and financial news related to the plant-based sector, is now also available in Chinese languages, bringing its reach to five languages in total.

10324,68% of Plant-Based Producers Would Like to Use Cultured Fats,https://vegconomist.com/studies-and-numbers/68-of-plant-based-producers-would-like-to-use-cultured-fats/,2020-12-15,"Peace of Meat, a B2B supplier of cultivated fat which was recently acquired by Meat Tech 3D, has released survey results revealing that up to 68% of plant-based meat producer respondents would be likely or very likely to incorporate cultivated fat into their products.  Peace of Meat surveyed 50 companies from Kind Earth Tech’s most recent New Protein Map, with 58% reporting that they are likely or very likely to use cultivated meat as an ingredient in their plant-based products. The Belgian based cultured fat innovator cites that, according to newprotein.org, the number of plant-based meat companies grew from 15 producers in 2015 to over 220 this year, stating that in such a rapidly expanding market space, the use of cultivated fat can provide brands with the opportunity to stand out from their competitors. In particular, in the following two areas. When companies were asked how likely they would be to use a cultivated fat ingredient if it specifically improves taste, the percentage of “likely” and “very likely” replies increased to 66%. An even higher number of companies, 68%, reported they would be likely or very likely to use cultivated fat if it improves texture and mouthfeel. Vegetable fats have a tendency to leak out of plant-based meats while cooking, diminishing tenderness and juiciness. Cultivated fat’s superior functional properties provide a solution to this. Cultivated fat can balance consumer demands for both indulgence and clean labels considering it has the potential to reduce the number of ingredients such as binding agents, flavours and fats. When asked how likely they would be to use cultivated fat if it reduces ingredients by 30-60%,68% of survey respondents replied they were likely or very likely. 96% of companies reported that they would prefer to use a cultivated fat ingredient that is non-GMO.  “Establishing a dialogue with over 50 companies in the plant-based field was eye-opening. The impact this industry has on animal welfare and sustainability is tremendous, yet convincing meat-eaters to change diets permanently remains a challenge. Cultured fat might be the missing ingredient creating real meatiness, and the plant-based industry is very receptive to this innovation,” comments Co-founder and Managing Director David Brandes. Peace of Meat is a B2B cultured fat supplier looking to collaborate with the plant-based meat industry in order to jointly produce hybrid cultured / plant-based meat alternatives.    "

The first run of the Raised & Rooted range came to the market in 2019 and contained egg whites. David Ervin, VP of alternative protein, has revealed that the egg will now be removed to fit the growing demand for vegan products.  The Raised & Rooted line has seen “impressive growth” throughout 2020, according to Ervin, prompting this switch to a fully vegan recipe. With the removal of egg whites from their nuggets, all Raised & Rooted products will now be free from any animal products, as of this month. Tyson Foods has been testing the waters with plant-based products since 2019, when they first came to the market. The summer of 2020 also saw the launch of the Raised & Rooted blended burger, The Blend, made from pea protein and Angus beef. Although Ervin reportedly still backs the potential of blended products, The Blend has now been discontinued, signalling a shift in focus to provide wholly vegan offerings. “We have seen velocities steadily increase each quarter on our all-plant line-up,” said Ervin, “with our most recent launches hitting strong initial velocities from the start.” The Raised & Rooted products are already available at over 10,000 retail locations across the US, with plans to expand further into Europe. Tyson Foods already has processing stations in the Netherlands and the UK and has plans to increase their offerings throughout the continent. “Consumers can expect to see additional new plant-based offerings from Raised & Rooted and other established brands coming to store shelves and quick-service locations in 2021,” Ervin told FoodNavigator-USA.

10340,GFI Releases “Asian Cropportunities” Alt-Protein Report,https://vegconomist.com/studies-and-numbers/gfi-releases-asian-cropportunities-alt-protein-report/,2020-12-14,"GFI Asia-Pacific has released a report entitled “Asian Cropportunities: Supplying Raw Materials for Plant-Based Meat”. The aim of the report is to explore new ingredients that could be used to make alt-protein products in Asia.  One of the main ideas behind the report is ingredient diversification — making the alt-protein sector less dependent on crops such as soy and wheat to reduce risk and make a wider variety of products available. While many plant-based companies are trying to break into Asia, the report theorises that there is untapped potential on the supply side. Plant-based ingredients could be grown and produced on a much wider scale across the continent, increasing availability and reducing costs worldwide. The report also looked at cultural differences in attitudes to alt-meat products. When asked why they buy meat substitutes, the most common response among Chinese customers was “Lower in fat [than animal meat]”. Other factors included “zero cholesterol”, “taste good”, “mouthfeel less greasy”, and “more nutritious”. In contrast, many Western consumers are motivated by ethical and environmental concerns. Another cultural difference is that meat substitutes have been available in many Asian countries for decades, mainly to cater to Buddhists. However, they have an image problem, being seen as inferior to meat and sold at lower prices. Demand for these products has not really increased over the years, so the challenge is to create alt-meat products that are not associated with these traditional mock meats. There are already signs of progress here, with the Chinese government investing in cultured meat and new plant-based food companies starting up in the country. Thai and Japanese companies are also working on alt-meat products. But while many Asian consumers may not be able to afford alt-meat at current prices, countries could still benefit from the growth of the plant-based sector by producing the ingredients used in these products. The full report can be found here.    "

Meat-Tech estimates that the first hybrid products based on the Peace of Meat cultured fat technology could be on the market as early as 2022.  Today saw the 100% acquisition of Belgium’s Peace of Meat PV, for €15 million in a combination of cash and MeaTech common stock. This follows a string of recent news from the Israeli biotech firm; this November it closed a fundraising round of $7 million just a day after the company, already publicly listed in Israel,  filed for IPO in the USA. Peace of Meat has developed a proprietary stem cell-based bioreactor technology to cultivate animal fats from chickens and ducks without harming the animals. The first expected application of the technology is in hybrid food products, where plant protein is combined with animal cultured fat to produce meat analogues with “meatiness” (taste and texture) properties closer to those of conventional meat products. The company believes it will be able to leverage Peace of Meat’s technologies, including novel hybrid food products, to accelerate market entry, while Meat-Tech will develop an industrial process for cultivating and producing real meat using 3D bio-printing technology without harming the animals. The transaction is expected to be completed in the coming weeks. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, MeaTech will pay half of the consideration immediately, with the balance to be paid subject to Peace of Meat meeting pre-defined technological milestones over a two-year period aimed at expanding its capacity to produce cultured fats in preparation for market entry. To this end, it was agreed that the management of Peace of Meat will continue to lead the development process. This acquisition is in line with Meat-Tech’s growth strategy, which aims to streamline development processes and expand the company’s product range in order to enter the cultured meat technology markets as quickly as possible. Meat-Tech is working to create synergies and added value for food manufacturers in the advanced production of cultured meat while maintaining animal welfare and meeting the growing global demand for meat.

10357,XPRIZE Launches $15M Competition “Feed the Next Billion”,https://vegconomist.com/fairs-and-events/xprize-launches-15m-competition-feed-the-next-billion/,2020-12-09,"XPRIZE this week announced the launch of its $15 million “Feed the Next Billion” competition in collaboration with ASPIRE. Through this four-year competition the non-profit organization claims that it intends to revolutionize the global food supply chain, transforming the whole meat industry in the process.  The competition follows the release of XPRIZE’s Future of Food Impact Roadmap, an in-depth analysis of global food system challenges. This resulted in the identification of a global need for alternative proteins at-scale, which was found to be a critical impact area that requires significant technological advances, decreased price points, and notable shifts in consumer preferences, while maintaining positive health and environmental benefits as compared to animal-based proteins. Launched in partnership with ASPIRE, the project management pillar of Abu Dhabi’s Advanced Technology Research Council (ATRC), The Tony Robbins Foundation, which helps providing millions of meals a year, and The Good Food Institute, XPRIZE intends to accelerate innovation within alternative meats and fish products that offer nutritious food security solutions. Within the competition, teams of global innovators will work to ensure that the world’s growing population has equal access to protein-rich, nutritious, and high-quality food. Thereby, XPRIZE “Feed the Next Billion” will challenge the winning teams to develop several consistent cuts of a meat alternative that replicates the appearance and nutritional properties of a textured fish or chicken breast fillet while having a lower comparable ecological footprint. Commenting on the global impact of the four-year competition, Faisal Al Bannai, Secretary-General of the Advanced Technology Research Council, which oversees ASPIRE, states: “Abu Dhabi has been instrumental in developing the global food security ecosystem, and we are continuously uncovering cutting-edge agriculture solutions that will shape the future of food production. Through our partnership with XPRIZE, we seek to unearth new technologies that will become solutions for all, helping people around the world access safe, sufficient, and affordable food. We’re excited to bring together top international talent and global innovators to develop solutions to answer one of the world’s most critical challenges.”    "
10366,Benjamin Netanyahu is First Head of State to Taste Cultivated Meat,https://vegconomist.com/politics-law/benjamin-netanyahu-is-first-head-of-state-to-taste-cultivated-meat/,2020-12-08,"Last year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed animal liberation and vegan activist Tal Gilboa to advise him on animal rights. In what could be perceived as a step towards an interest to move meat away from animal ag on the advice of Gilboa, he this week took part in a publicised trip to sample Aleph Farms’ cultured meat.  After Singapore became the first country in the world to allow cultivated meat for sale last week, the “space race for the future of food” now continues. Israel wants to position itself on the forefront of the global alternative protein ecosystem, and is home to the most foodtech companies for cultivated meat, with companies including SuperMeat, initiator of the world’s first cultivated chicken restaurant experience; Meat-Tech, the world’s first publicly listed cultivated meat company; and FutureMeat, which last year built the world’s first meat pilot production facility. Aleph Farms, which was founded and nurtured by The Kitchen Hub incubator of the Strauss Group in collaboration with Israel Institute of Technology, is considered the producer of the first prototype of a commercial cultivated steak that has been tasted by the Prime Minister during his visit. The visit, which was accompanied by The Good Food Institute Israel’s Managing Director Nir Goldstein, also included a presentation by Goldstein and Aleph Farms’ Co-Founder and CEO Didier Toubia, who shared the organization’s National Policy Plan, a detailed roadmap for making Israel the global alternative protein leader. The Prime Minister commented on taste and the procedure to be followed for Israel’s alternative protein sector as follows: “It’s delicious and guilt-free, I can’t taste the difference. I have directed the State Secretary Tzahi Braverman to appoint a body to serve these industries in order to connect and oversee all the stakeholders operating in this field. Israel will become a powerhouse for alternative meat and alternative protein.” “Alternative protein production could prove to be a central economic growth engine for Israel,” explains Nir Goldstein, Managing Director of The Good Food Institute Israel. “With governmental support in this industry, we could enjoy 11,000 additional jobs that would earn the economy billions of dollars each year. Israel which currently exports only 5% of the food it produces, could become a global supplier of raw materials and advanced production technologies for alternative proteins. This can all become a reality, in part thanks to the governmental support thus far, but it also depends on government funding from here on of scientific research and development to turbo-charge alternative protein innovation,” concludes Goldstein.

As a leading supplier to the biopharma industry and through our expertise in areas such as cell culture media and bioprocessing technologies, we are well positioned to accelerate the emerging cultured meat industry as a technology enabler. There are additional reasons beyond the business objectives. As a company, we believe that we can use science and technology to help address critical global challenges. This motivation was recently emphasized by the launch of our sustainability strategy with the clear objective to reach the global UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Climate change threatens to reduce the amount of land and water available for agriculture, while our growing population requires more animal proteins at the same time. Cultured meat can provide a further, more sustainable and ethical option for meat-eating consumers. This vision keeps us highly engaged and motivated. What is your USP as a company?
The technologies applied to culture meat cells are similar for the biopharma- and cell therapy industry. Our Life Science sector is dedicated to developing innovative tools, supplies & processes that make biomanufacturing reliable, faster and safer. The broad product- and solution portfolios have helped the pharmaceutical industry solve major technical challenges over the past 30 years. We leverage this expertise in areas such as culture media and bioprocessing, to develop innovative technologies and platforms that will enable the cultured meat industry, from R&D to the efficient scale-up of production. You take a holistic view on this emerging industry, what does that mean?
Currently, we have more than a dozen dedicated scientists and engineers working on the innovation field and related projects. But we don’t stop there. We established cross-divisional working groups to deal with topics such as regulations and drive discussions with regulatory authorities and policy makers. We also work closely with external partners, including universities, start-ups and non-profit organizations such as the Berkeley Alternative Meat Lab, BAL Pro Germany and the Good Food Institute. And we raise awareness for the field and drive consumer acceptance by communicating and educating stakeholders and the public. You want to cover the whole value chain, please explain that for our readers.
We won’t actually produce cultured meat or sell it to consumers ourselves. Our focus is to develop innovative tools and solutions to enable a scaled and safe production of the meat. And here, we are looking at the full production chain – from support in optimizing meat producer cell lines, the development of suitable and efficient animal-free cell culture media to technologies for the production of edible scaffolds and scalable bioprocess design. One of your flagship projects is developing cell culture media. What is the status here and what else is coming up on the horizon?
Yes, serum-free cell culture media is still the major cost driver for clean meat products. Our flagship project receives significant internal funding to design and commercialize custom media formulations, in close collaboration with Life Science R&D. Our objective is the development of a safe, high performance and cost-efficient formulation. This means that we also evaluate options not utilized by the biopharma industry presently. We have already signed revenue-generating partnership agreements with leading cultured meat startups and will launch a first minimal viable product soon. In addition, we kicked-off a string of innovation projects and continuously build strong connections and partnerships with startups and leading clean meat organizations. To complement the lab work, we also co-founded a Cultivated Meat Modeling Consortium with external experts to build a computational modeling and simulation platform. What growth do you expect for the market in the next ten years?
Becoming a commodity is still a long journey and there is still a lot of innovation needed. Our estimate is that it will probably take another five to ten years to find cultured meat in your supermarket. But the industry takes major steps forward. Startups make their first prototypes already available for exclusive tastings. SuperMeat, for example, offers their cultured chicken at a restaurant in Tel Aviv to get first-hand feedback from customers. We expect that products will be launched first in high end restaurants; this may happen over the next two years. This will help to drive consumer acceptance and test the production and supply chain resiliency. At the same time, we know that there are still several important scale and cost challenges to solve before actual commercial products can be offered at a competitive prize. For this to happen, collaboration will be critical. Startups, meat producers, facilities construction- and engineering firms, regulators & policy makers – and suppliers like us – need to work together to push the field forward. We expect major innovation breakthroughs to happen during the next ten years through the collaboration mentioned and acceleration from the government through funding & public-private partnerships, e.g. UC Davis Cultivated Meat Consortium (CMC) in the US or the ‘Meat4All’ consortium in Europe. Post 2030, the industry will probably take off rapidly, gaining market shares from conventional meat consumers. Similar to what we are seeing with plant-based meats today – or at an even faster pace.    "

New questions and doubts from consumers on seafood safety arise as our oceans become more polluted by an increasing variety of pollutants. For open sea fishing, return on investment to improve fishing equipment and productivity is diminishing due to dwindling natural fish stocks. Aquacultural practices have multiple problems as concentrated animal operations. “Veganism is against the exploitation of and cruelty to animals for food. Using animals as a protein delivery method is hugely inefficient. It is now becoming obvious that it is a system issue. Therefore, systemic change is a necessity and not a preference.” Co-founder and CEO, Jiyi Chen said this week: “Avant is delighted to be working with so many important investors who can help us in every aspect of our business, including production technology, customer relationships, and ongoing support. We will do our utmost to continue our efforts in the sustainable seafood and alternative protein industry and to introduce our products into the existing global supply chain as soon as possible.”    "

The e-commerce platform, referred to as the vegan Amazon, aims to build an ecosystem around plant-based living.  In April, vegconomist reported that the Canadian alternative protein company Modern Meat had partnered with PlantX to launch its pre-made meal delivery service. Last month, PlantX, the “Vegan Amazon”, expanded its e-commerce platform to the US, in the footsteps of Hawaiian bulk plant-based delivery service VEDGEco, the “Vegan Costco”, which expanded to mainland US in August. Founder of PlantX is Sean Dollinger, himself a vegan and serial entrepreneur, who at the age of 17 founded a supply company that became the largest of its kind in Canada. CEO of the startup is Julia Frank, who has formerly worked for major companies like BMW and Daimler in Germany. Development indicates that plant-based is a megatrend that steals market share from major global food services and threatens to completely transform the distribution of players in the $26 billion foodservice sector. In this context, it can be assumed that if PlantX succeeds in building a complete plant-based ecosystem for the world, it could potentially steal market shares from global e-commerce giant Amazon, as reported by Yahoo Finance. PlantX founder Sean Dollinger already expressed his global ambitions in an interview first published in Authority Magazine. “PlantX was the idea that I moved forward with to hopefully get a whole movement going around plant-based living. In the past, I’ve run successful businesses, but never had a natural impact and that’s what we’re looking to do. It’s the ripple effect: by helping one person, it begins to spread positivity — hopefully — throughout the world.”    "

On her first day with Change Foods, Gerry is a keynote speaker at the Alt-Dairy Conference which takes place today, giving the keynote titled The Dawn of the Food Revolution.  Led by David Bucca, Australian plantbased entrepreneur of Hungry Planet and Food Frontier – an independent think tank focused on alternative proteins; the company recently closed its second funding round of $875k, backed by high profile investors from Google, as well as Twitter’s Maya Hari, Michal Klar, Simon Newstead, Tom Crago, Vikas Garg, and others. The company has plans to raise an addional $5M in Q2 of 2021. But what happens once animal-free cheese hits the market? Will consumers understand and accept it? What is the proposition of the product and the brand behind it? These are critical questions to enable product success in market, hence the hiring of a plant-based industry veteran to its executive team. As fresh CMO, Irina Gerry, brings along her experience in plant-based foods and beverages. Irina was a force behind major brand initiatives on Silk, a leading plant-based brand, including product innovation, packaging design, and multiple marketing campaigns. She championed Silk’s entrance into new segments, such as nutrition-forward beverages and ready-to-drink coffee. Recently, Irina led two major new platform launches for both Silk and So Delicious brands, hitting shelves in January. Irina holds an MBA from Harvard Business School. “Irina is a true consumer expert who understands how to get to the core insight and deliver products loved by millions. Her impressive skills are matched only by her deep passion for sustainability,” said Founder and CEO, David Bucca. “Irina shares our purpose to create a sustainable, thriving, and kind food system. We could not have found a better executive team member to shape our brand vision to drive this change.” “I was drawn to the Change Foods team, based on our shared mission to change the world,” said Irina Gerry. “David and I are both parents and as we looked at the climate crisis threatening our children’s future, we just could not sit idly. This is our fight, and it is an urgent one. Removing industrially farmed animals from the global food supply is a key part of the climate solution and we have the right tech, skills and team to do just that.”    "
10400,Eat Just’s Cultivated Chicken Approved: “A New Space Race for the Future of Food is Underway”,https://vegconomist.com/food-and-beverage/eat-justs-cultivated-chicken-approved-a-new-space-race-for-the-future-of-food-is-underway/,2020-12-02,"The GFI has said that today a ‘new space race for the future of food’ has begun as Singapore becomes the first country in the world to approve cultivated meat for sale. Eat Just, famous for JUST Egg, has been granted permission  for the sale of cultivated chicken ‘bites’ to the public. As we predicted last week, cultured meat is here.  Eat Just revealed in October its $120 million facility in Singapore and its plans to move into cultured meat, and in conversation with vegconomist later that month the company confirmed its development of cultured chicken, stating: “We’re excited about our small-scale commercial launch of cultured chicken as soon as we have a regulatory pathway. We’ve been working on this with regulators in several parts of the world and can’t wait for consumers to taste it.” Josh Tetrick, CEO of Eat Just, says today, “Singapore has long been a leader in innovation of all kinds, from information technology to biologics to now leading the world in building a healthier, safer food system. I’m sure that our regulatory approval for cultured meat will be the first of many in Singapore and in countries around the globe. Working in partnership with the broader agriculture sector and forward-thinking policymakers, companies like ours can help meet the increased demand for animal protein as our population climbs to 9.7 billion by 2050.” Bruce Friedrich, GFI Executive Director, says: “Singapore has thrown down the gauntlet and other countries need to pick it up […] A new space race for the future of food is underway. As nations race to divorce meat production from industrial animal agriculture, countries that delay their investment in this bright food future risk getting left behind. The government that manages to divorce meat production from the need for living animals is going to have bragging rights until the end of time.” “This marks the beginning of a new era,” said Elaine Siu, Managing Director of The Good Food Institute APAC. “The race to divorce meat production from industrial animal agriculture is underway and nations that follow Singapore’s lead will be able to reap the benefits as the entire world shifts to this new and better way of making meat. “Other countries: Your turn!”    "
10402,New Plant-Based Developments in China as Vegan Market in Asia Continues to Soar,https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/new-plant-based-developments-in-china-as-vegan-market-in-asia-continues-to-soar/,2020-12-02,"Hero Protein is a Chinese alt-meat startup based in Shanghai. It is working on developing plant-based meat alternatives, starting with beef, chicken, and fish. Meanwhile, Chinese fast-food chain Dico, the third largest fast-food enterprise in China, announces the launch of vegan chicken burgers and nuggets.  In September, the company closed its pre-seed funding round. This will allow it to further develop its products, which are not yet on the market. Among its investors was the Lever China Alternative Protein Fund. The company’s meat alternatives are made mainly with soy, wheat, and peas. They are free of GMOs, an important selling point in China where consumers are very aware of food safety issues. Unlike some Western alt-meat brands that have tried to gain traction in the country, Hero’s plant meats are tailored to the Chinese market. Other Chinese companies such as Zhenmeat and Hey Maet are taking a similar approach, making products that can be used in popular Asian dishes such as stir-fries and dumplings. Meanwhile, Chinese fast-food chain Dicos has announced it is launching vegan chicken burgers and nuggets. It has partnered with Shenzhen-based alt-meat brand Starfield to offer the new options. Starfield became China’s fastest-growing plant-based brand when it raised $10M back in August. The vegan chicken will be available at most mainland Dicos stores, over 2,600 locations in total. Dicos is the first large Chinese chain to offer plant-based meat, though Western chains have trialled meat-free burgers in the country. “Our intention is to provide more young consumers in China with opportunities to try plant-based meat, while also advocating for a ‘green diet’ concept,” Dicos’ chief marketing officer Xie Yahui told Red Star News.

10420,Indian Cell-Based Meat Company Claims it Has Achieved Price Parity,https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/indian-cell-based-meat-company-claims-it-has-achieved-price-parity/,2020-11-30,"Clear Meat, an Indian cell-based meat company, has developed cultured chicken mince that it claims is already as affordable to produce as conventional processed chicken.  The company says it has chosen to focus on chicken because it is one of the most affordable and widely consumed meats in India. Processed chicken currently costs INR1000 (about $13.46) in the country, while Clear Meat’s mince costs INR800-850 ($10.77-11.44) to produce. But the company isn’t going to stop there — it wants to bring down the price even more, making its product significantly cheaper than conventional processed chicken. Last year, ClearMeat was involved in the first cohort of the ProVeg Incubator. At the time, it said its goal was to “accelerate clean meat adoption in India and to have enormous environmental, animal welfare and nutritional impact”. Studies have shown that Asian consumers, including Indians, are generally more open to cultured meat than Westerners. The Indian government began promoting the research and development of clean meat last year, and in June of this year, China called for a strategy to ensure it didn’t fall behind in this area. But there are still challenges — there is a strong anti-GMO sentiment in India, and Clear Meat worries that consumers may confuse cultured meat with GMOs. There may also be issues around labelling. Despite these challenges, the company believes it will soon be ready to scale up. “We’re at the stage where we can think of creating an industrial setup and look at funding, then progress to a licensing and commercialisation stage,” Clear Meat co-founder Dr. Siddharth Manvati told FoodNavigator-Asia.

10430,"8 Reasons Why the Future of Meat is Cell-Based, Not Animal-Based",https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/8-reasons-why-the-future-of-meat-is-cell-based-not-animal-based/,2020-11-26,"The plant-based market is growing steadily, but in the future cell-based products may dominate and increasingly compete with plant-based products. By 2040, plant-based and cell-based meat alternatives are set to account for 60% of the market. We are moving towards a future where meat does not come from animals.  According to Edison Investment Research, cell-based products provide the potential to disrupt the market, especially regarding production with low environmental impact. The industry is expected to be ready for mass production as early as 2025 and to be priced on a par with conventional meat. Large meat producers are already investing, such as Tyson, Cargill and Merck. 1 – It tastes good: This April, scientists in Maastricht University blind-tested participants and found that they rated the flavour of the ‘cultured’ hamburger as better than that of the ‘ordinary’ one. Furthermore, 58 percent of the respondents said they would be prepared to pay a premium for cultured meat at an average of 37 percent on top of the price of ordinary meat. 2 – Consumer acceptance: French and German consumers were found this September to be open to trying cultured meat and 58% of Germans would like to eat it. A study back in May found consumers to be increasingly accepting of the idea of cellbased meat, with acceptance at almost 50% for younger and more educated respondents. And in 2019 a survey found Asian consumers to be very open-minded to new concepts in food such as cell-based. 3 – Eat Just is in: In October, Eat Just, producer of the phenomenon that is the JUST Egg, announced a $100M facility in Singapore and said that cultured products will be next. Speaking to vegconomist, Just’s Andrew Noyes said: “We’re excited about our small-scale commercial launch of cultured chicken as soon as we have a regulatory pathway.”Anything these guys touch turns to vegan gold, so watch this space. 4 – Investment: In January, Memphis Meat completed the largest funding round in cell-based history with $161 million from investors including Bill Gates and Richard Branson. The EU invested €2.7 million showing that Brussels sees a cellbased future, and in September, UC Davis received a $3.5 million five-year grant for cultured meat research. 5 – Future cost: The Dutch cultured meat pioneer Mosa Meats reduced its production costs by 88 times and the South African producer of cultured beef and chicken Mzansi Meat plans to achieve price parity within the next 5-10 years. 6 – Corporates are already in: Multinational companies are increasingly turning to cell-based, Cargill, for example invested in Aleph Farms and fast-food giant KFC signed an agreement with Mosa Meats to secure the company’s cultured chicken alternatives as soon as they are commercially available. Such commericialisation will allow for compteitive pricing. 7 – Cultured meat is already publicly listed: Israeli startup Meat Tech 3D is the world’s first cultivated meat company publicly listed in Israel and has filed for IPO in the US. 8 – Seafood is very close: The cell-based seafood industry is close to market introduction as BlueNalu plans to launch its cell-based seafood products in the second half of 2021. Shiok Meats plans to launch its minced shrimp products in 2022 and recently unveiled a cultured lobster product at a testing event in Singapore. The lobster product is set to launch to market after the shrimp. In fact, the challenge for the cell-based industry does not lay in the area of innovation potential or consumer acceptance, but rather in food safety regulations. Forbes said on the matter: “What’s nice about the US regulatory system is that it is product-focused rather than process-focused so instead of making sure every step of our process is the same as how a fish would grow meat, it looks at the end product, which is more scientific.” In an interview with vegconomist, the founder of Mzansi Meat Brett Thompson agreed: “We’ve seen that the challenge for cultivated meat companies in most markets worldwide is actually regulatory and food safety compliance and not necessarily anything relating to cell proliferation or scale-up.”    "

The programs were created in 2013 to promote growth and sustainability in Colorado’s advanced industries by driving innovation and increasing the state’s capacity to be globally competitive. Says Senior Manager Katie Woslager, “These innovative companies create jobs and leverage additional investment in Colorado, and are even more important as the nation focuses on economic recovery.”  Bond Pet Foods received $250,000 from the program for its reinvention of pet nutrition, creating dog and cat foods sourced from real animal protein, without the animal. In December last year Bond completed seed funding totaling $1.2 million and completed a seed extension this year for an overall raise of just under $2M to date. This August this year the startup announced the first prototype of its “chicken without the chicken”, which Bond says will revolutionise the pet food space. Speaking to vegconomist at the time, co-founder Rich Kellman explained that “We’re currently the only company developing meat proteins through microbial fermentation in the pet food space […] We’ll be making other cultured meat proteins in the years ahead for pet nutrition, like turkey, pork, and beef. Other applications including the human food space are also being explored. He added, “Our mission at Bond Pet Foods is to be an ally for all animals through a commitment to finding a better way to make complete, nutritious food for our pets.”    "

Lou Cooperhouse, co-founder, CEO and president of BlueNalu, added: “We are extremely thankful to the team at Agronomics for their continued support, and we are pleased to welcome Jim Mellon as an observer to our Board of Directors. Agronomics has participated in each of our financing rounds thus far, and has a keen understanding regarding the role that cell-based seafood can play in the global supply chain.”    "
10466,Patrik Baboumian Collaborates With Upfield for a Better Plant-Based Future,https://vegconomist.com/health/patrik-baboumian-collaborates-with-upfield-for-a-better-plant-based-future/,2020-11-19,"Like no other, Patrik Baboumian embodies the power and health that a plant-based diet can bring. He achieved worldwide fame through the 2018 Netflix documentary The Game Changers, discussing the subject of ideal nutrition for top sporting performance, produced by Jackie Chan, Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron.  Born in Iran, Patrik was raised by women in a war zone after a traffic accident of his father, a tragedy that shaped him and awakened his desire to be strong. In 1986 he moved to Germany and at the age of 15 began to take an interest in weight training. After some bodybuilding competitions, he participated in the Strongman Championships for the first time in 2006. The participants come from a wide variety of strength-focused sports and compete in disciplines such as pushing vehicles, lifting beer barrels, and carrying weighted steel frames. In 2011 Patrik finally won the title as the strongest man in Germany. Patrik became vegetarian in 2005; “In order to still consume enough protein, I ate large quantities of dairy products for a while,” he reports. “But in the process, I realised that my diet was still causing animal suffering and, above all, harming the environment.” After all, cattle breeding for meat and dairy products is one of the main reasons for deforestation. The resulting loss of natural habitats is a crucial aspect of climate change and species extinction.” Since 2011 Patrik has been vegan and in 2015 he published a cookbook for vegan nutrition together with his wife Katy. He is keen to support Upfield, the world’s leading producer of plant-based spreads, in its new campaign. “Strength alone is useless,” says Patrik. “You must combine it with a specific purpose.” Patrik and Upfield are pursuing the same goal, actively campaigning for a plant-based, climate-friendly diet that is good for people and the planet. In June, the company launched the global online platform A Better Plant-based Future, which aims to whet people’s appetite for plant-based nutrition. The premise being that a change of diet is not that difficult and can begin with small steps – for example, switching from butter to vegetable margarine. Patrik demonstrates this with his recipe, specially selected for the campaign: “When it comes to food, my whole family is very much influenced by Persian cuisine. From my childhood days, I remember lots of stews with legumes and a range of meat dishes. The omission of meat in the dishes I grew up with did not harm the meals and their taste – I just had to find an alternative protein, such as chickpeas. This dish reminds me of my mother and my Persian ancestors. It is everything I love about a good meal: delicious, easy to prepare, and full of protein.” In a short documentary on the online platform, Patrik talks about his history, his training motivation and his enthusiasm for the vegan lifestyle. His aim is to show people that they can achieve everything in sports with a plant-based diet.    "

As a food ingredient company, 3F BIO will trade as ENOUGH® and is building a first of its kind high scale facility in the Netherlands to produce and sell mycoprotein as a food ingredient in 2022. ENOUGH is planning to have 50k tonnes of installed capacity by 2027 and the Company aims to produce 1M tonnes cumulatively within 10 years of launch. The Good Food Institute published a first-of-its-kind report in September highlighting fermentation as a key concept for the realisation of a sustainable food system. The report found that globally in 2019, fermentation companies raised over 3.5 times more capital than cultivated meat companies, with $770M invested into fermentation companies in the last two years. Andrew Beasley, Commercial Director for 3F BIO & ENOUGH said: “We are delighted about this collaboration with Marks & Spencer.  The collective purpose of 3F BIO and ENOUGH is to ‘Make Protein Sustainable’ and by doing so we want to make a positive impact on the environment, and on global nutrition.  We will only do this by making great food that consumers love and therefore we address this by growing mycoprotein, an existing advantaged ingredient with an established market role, more sustainably and at a lower cost than all other protein options such that it can have an impact at scale. “We are hugely excited by the application possibilities of mycoprotein. ABUNDA mycoprotein is a fermented food ingredient, and it is truly special, not only because we can make delicious foods with it, but because it is also sustainable, healthy and nutritious.  So many plant protein foods today contain way too many ingredients.  With mycoprotein, we can make foods with short ingredient lists, which are common to our kitchens today.”    "
10472,Aleph Farms Reveals Prototype of First Commercial Cultivated Steak,https://vegconomist.com/science/aleph-farms-reveals-prototype-of-first-commercial-cultivated-steak/,2020-11-18,"Aleph Farms Ltd announces it is heading towards the availability of its thin-cut beef steaks suitable for mass cultivation. The prototype of its commercial product will be first introduced at the Asia-Pacific Agri-Food Innovation Summit on November 20th in Singapore  To successfully grow whole pieces of meat, the company mimics the extra-cellular matrix found in animals with a plant-based matrix that enables the cells to grow and form structured tissues of meat. Its ‘cell-banks’ yield an unlimited source of pluripotent, non-GMO cow cells’ for growing large quantities of meat without the dependency on living animals. Aleph Farms famously developed the world’s first cell-based burger back in 2018 and has since then increased the size of its slaughter-free product and adapted it to fit controlled, automated bioprocesses to ensure economic viability in large-scale production. The move marks a major leap in Aleph Farms’ goal of making cultivated meat widely available in the global community. The company is currently transitioning its commercial products to pilot plant (BioFarmTM). The pilot launch is planned for the end of 2022. “One of the big challenges of cultivated meat is the ability to produce large quantities efficiently at a cost that can compete with conventional meat industry pricing, without compromising on quality,” says Didier Toubia, Co-Founder and CEO of Aleph Farms. “We have developed five technological building blocks unique to Aleph Farms that are put into a large-scale production process, all patented by the company.” “Aleph Farms is establishing a new category of meat, imbued with its own culture and a new world of meaty experiences,” enthuses Amir Ilan, the company’s Resident Chef. “It’s not enough to just make a protein that will fill the nutritional gap; we need to capture the fullness of the meat-eating experience,” adds Toubia. As a French native with roots in food culture, and having studied food engineering in Dijon, Toubia brings his appreciation of gastronomic tradition to his unique cultivation technology. “Meat can be cultivated from cells isolated from different animal breeds, have different cuts, and it elicits different emotions. We see Aleph Farms as crafters of experiences.” Toubia concludes.    "
10473,Wicked Foods to Expand Worldwide After Conquering UK Market,https://vegconomist.com/food-and-beverage/wicked-foods-to-expand-worldwide-after-conquering-uk-market/,2020-11-18,"Wicked Foods, the UK market leader in plant-based meals, snacks and ingredients created and operated by chef brothers Chad and Derek Sarno, announces plans for a global expansion in Summer 2021 with an initial USA launch, after revolutionizing plant-based supermarket food in the UK.  Wicked Healthy first launched with 20 products under the Wicked Kitchen brand in January 2018 at Tesco, the largest supermarket chain in the UK, making headlines for the incredible public response. 4 million units were sold in the first 33 weeks upon release and 10 million were sold in just 20 months. Since 2018, the line has extended to more than 80 products across Tesco stores. Entering the global market, Wicked Foods will continue its work in increasing availability and providing convenient meal solutions, at the same time as challenging perceptions of vegan food. Wicked Foods highlights the power of plants in changing the way the world eats by creating best-in-class vegan food, with a focus on influencing meat-eaters. “Our mission is to help people cook and eat more plants knowing that we’ll be saving millions and millions of animals each day which improves our planet while supporting our farmers and our health,” says Derek Sarno. “We’ve created the tools, recipes and products to make it simple, flavorful and fun for people to eat more plant-based foods in the UK, and we are excited to now bring these to the US, Canada and other European countries.” Wicked Foods’ expansion is being led by new CEO Pete Speranza, a CPG industry vet and Unovis partner, who will bring his extensive experience and tactical know-how to the brand’s day-to-day operations. Wicked Foods joins other innovative brands in the portfolio of Unovis, a leading global investment firm disrupting conventional animal agriculture. Founding partner Chris Kerr has worked closely with the Sarno brothers to develop and launch the Wicked Foods brand. “In my nearly 25 years in CPG, I haven’t seen anything quite like what Chad and Derek have been able to create with Wicked Foods,” says Speranza. “Their commitment to producing the most crave-able, sought after, chef-crafted plant-based foods is driving huge demand in the UK, and we know Americans are ready for this genuine and unapologetic approach to plant-based eating. Beyond that, it’s not only vegans that are creating demand but also mainstream consumers who want in on alternative protein options that put flavor first.”    "
10480,Number of German Vegans Doubles to 2.6 Million in Just Four Years,https://vegconomist.com/studies-and-numbers/number-of-german-vegans-doubles-to-2-6-million-in-just-four-years/,2020-11-18,"A survey carried out by vegan food producer Veganz has analysed the dietary habits of 2,600 people in seven European countries. The study found that Germany has the most vegans, with the number having doubled from 1.3 million in 2016 to 2.6 million in 2020 — a total of 3.2 percent of the population.  Denmark and Switzerland were in second and third place, with 2.7 and 2.6 percent of the population identifying as vegan respectively. France was in last place, with just 0.9 percent of people eating a vegan diet. Across all seven countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Portugal, and Denmark), an average of 1.9 percent of people were vegan, 3.1 percent vegetarian, 2.9 percent pescetarian, and 22.9 percent flexitarian. That left 69.1 percent of people eating a fully omnivorous diet. Flexitarianism is a growing trend in all seven countries — even in Portugal, where the traditional diet is meat-heavy, 28.6 percent of people are reducing their meat consumption. Most flexitarians cited health as their primary motivation for changing their diet, while most vegans cited animal rights. Interestingly, 59.1 percent of flexitarians said that sustainability and environmental protection were important when buying food, but only 38.9 percent of vegans agreed. Of course, these figures have been extrapolated from the relatively small number of people taking part in the study, so it’s unclear how representative they are. But the results are certainly promising, especially since many omnivores and flexitarians said they would consider going vegetarian or vegan. The study suggests that if everyone who would consider going plant-based did so, just 42 percent of people would still be omnivores. Other recent studies have confirmed this trend, showing a large demand for cultured meat in Europe and the continued decline of meat consumption in Germany. “A lot of people will ask themselves: can I still swallow mountains of meat without reflecting on the consequences?” Hanni Rützler, a researcher at the Future Institute in Vienna, told Westdeutsche Zeitung. “The understanding of enjoyment has changed, away from more and more, faster and cheaper.”    "
10482,David Yeung: “Blessed to Be in a Position to Drive Impact and Tangible Positive Change on a Daily Basis”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/david-yeung-blessed-to-be-in-a-position-to-drive-impact-and-tangible-positive-change-on-a-daily-basis/,2020-11-17,"It would be difficult to find anyone in plant-based who is not familiar with the work of David Yeung in 2020 when OmniFoods raised a record $70 million; was ranked in Fortune‘s Change the World list; and launched the first-ever vegetarian menu at McDonald’s. With no plans to slow down, here he reveals even more coming news for 2021.  Following the incredible fundraise, which was the highest of its kind in Asia, Mr Yeung said that he will expand OmniFoods and Green Common across Asia, Africa, North America, and Europe and has plans for no less than 20,000 new retail locations. There seems to be no end to his ambitions – we asked him how such continual success is possible and what is next for OmniFoods and the phenomenon of the OmniPork Luncheon Meat, AKA vegan SPAM. How do you feel after such a successful financing round? Did you foresee such massive success from the outset?
The overwhelming interest from investors globally reflects a rising awareness for plant-based diets as the solution to pressing global issues and a growing demand to tap into the market potential brought by the confluence of global consumer trends towards sustainability and conscious consumption. Consumers worldwide are rethinking how they eat and what they eat amidst supply chain disruptions and public concern over the link between meat production and viral diseases. This has prompted a surge in demand for plant-based products, particularly in Asia where African Swine Fever has decimated pork production and pushed prices up. What exactly will Green Monday use the investment for?
The fundraising completed by Green Monday Holdings (the business arm of the group) will provide the capital necessary for both Green Common and OmniFoods to enhance their R&D efforts for more innovative plant-based food products, boost production, distribution and supply chain capabilities, scale up the retail network, and strengthen partnerships with F&B brands. To be specific, by Q1 2021 we aim to:  Is it correct to say that this marks the entrance of Green Common / OmniFoods into Western countries including Europe?
It should happen in 2021. Obviously Covid creates tons of uncertainty on many things, but our entry into various countries in Europe will start to happen next year.  Which products would you hope to roll out into these new markets? We would love to see the luncheon meat in Europe and we have had Japanese readers ask about if it would launch into Japan – anything we can tell them to look forward to?
Indeed we have just soft-launched OmniPork in Japan.  One of the channels to buy is online at The Meat Guy. As for OmniPork Luncheon in certain countries in Europe, most likely starting in the UK and Germany, that will happen in 2021. What kind of trading partners is Green Monday seeking in general?
From the very first beginning, we choose mission-aligned partners who share the same goal to strive for genuine impact, channel their power to make further good to the world, and overcome the planet’s most imminent challenges – climate change, food insecurity and public health. OmniFoods has seen an incredible year with so much news coming through with your success – how do you find the time to achieve all of these consistent milestones?!
None of these milestones can be achieved without disciplined execution and team efforts, and great teamwork starts from strong recruiting.  So my not-so-secret formula to lead our movement and company is to surround myself with mission-driven, passionate and ultra-talented team members.  American plant-based companies are increasingly focusing on Asia and especially in China. Do you feel there is already a powerful competition for Green Monday – and if not, what makes your approach different from the rest?
I have repeated many times: our real competition is the meat and dairy industries. So the success of all plant-based brands and companies only adds more fuel and momentum to the overall global movement.  That said, in the case of Green Monday and Green Common, we have been building an ecosystem and platform since day one. We are the turn-key distributor and strategic investor for numerous plant-based brands such as Beyond Meat, Califia Farms, and Alpha Foods.  We share our established retail and F&B network and branding & marketing know-how with them, with the goal to accelerate their entry into the various Asian markets.  Ultimately, with both our own brand and the ones we distribute, we are creating a one-stop destination both for end consumers and for retail and restaurant partners.  As for more authentic Asian food, our own OmniFoods range caters to such needs.  This holistic and synergistic platform has proven to be an incredibly effective model to spearhead this new generation plant-based food category to the various markets. How do you see the market in China and Asia in general changing right now – could you imagine a plant-based China?
We see enormous potential for growth. China has been severely affected by African Swine Fever, so Mainland consumers have more reasons to explore alternative protein. We are already seeing major chains such as Starbucks, Yum, ALDI, JiXiang, White Castle launching plant-based menu. According to many studies and research, plant-based meat will reach 10% of the meat market in 10 years.  While in the short term there is clearly a lot of education and awareness building necessary, if we look at a 10 or even 20-year window, we see such a goal as be highly achievable AND necessary.  Do you have any plan to work with McDonald’s in other regions to launch more plant-based options? I can’t disclose specifics, but we are delighted to say that the Hong Kong launch has received lots of positive feedback. What is the ultimate goal of your work, or do you have a life ambition?
My life goal is very simple: maximize my positive impact on the world, which also means the maximization of purpose and meaning of my life.  In Green Monday, my team and I are super blessed to be in a position to drive impact and tangible positive change on a daily basis.     "

10503,Mzansi Meat: “We’re Confident We Will Achieve Price Parity with Conventional Meat Products Within the Next 5-10 Years”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/mzansi-meat-were-confident-we-will-achieve-price-parity-with-conventional-meat-products-within-the-next-5-10-years/,2020-11-12,"Plant-based meats have taken huge strides in recent years, taking over restaurants and supermarkets around the world. As many in the plant-based and alt protein space already know, the next big step is making cultivated meat affordable and widely available. Mzansi Meat in South Africa is working on doing just that.  Mzansi Meat recently opened a new lab space is in the Cape Innovation and Technology Initiative (CiTi) in Woodstock, Cape Town, and is cultivating beef and chicken for the  South African and African market. Mzansi Meat says it is the first South African meat company that is profoundly motivated by conservation and animal welfare. We spoke with founder Brett Thompson about the challenges it has faced, plans for the future, and much more. What makes Mzansi Meat Co. different from other cultivated meat companies?
We’re the first company of its kind focused on Africa, which provides us with an opportunity to shape the narrative and create the market. We also have access to commercially viable species and the ability to leverage the first mover advantage whilst having access to talented scientific talent who possess an innately South African entrepreneurial spirit. Please tell us about the animal conservation work that your team is involved in.
Cellular agriculture does not rely on producing more slaughter animals to provide meat for a growing human population. Thus, on a macro-scale, Mzansi Meat Co aims to make a significant contribution to animal and wildlife conservation in Africa by removing the need to transform more natural land into fodder crop production units. The result will be an increase in meat production while conserving natural habitats for animals. What have been the biggest challenges to date that you have encountered with establishing Mzansi Meat? Have you overcome these?
One of our biggest challenges was where to begin, which meat type to start working with. We are so fortunate in Africa to have so many domestic and wildlife species to choose from and linking that to the different requirements necessary to produce wholesome and healthy meat. After some exhaustive investigation, we are now focusing on just two animal types, namely the cow and the chicken. We hear that you are also involved with the Credence Institute, can you tell us about that?
I started the Credence Institute with Ludwig Raal in South Africa. Credence aims to advance the interests of animals through market-based solutions and supports companies looking to provide innovative protein options to consumers. Credence will be doing one of the largest research projects to date on consumer perceptions of plant-based and cultivated meat which will benefit many stakeholders involved in the protein space including Mzansi, Fry Family Food co. and retailers. And what about the challenges going forward? What do you think these will be and how will you overcome them?
Like most regions, Biotech in southern Africa is primarily focused on medical science. However, unlike other regions – primarily in the developed world – there is limited funding available to the burgeoning work in the science of food. Attracting talent from established fields involved in cancer research and sports injury is one of our largest challenges and finding the funds to incentivise researchers to consider food biotech as a viable career path. We are also laying the bricks as we walk down the path of public perception in this new food production system because the level of awareness on cultivated meat is extremely low. This provides an opportunity to shape the conversation and be transparent with the public to circumnavigate some of the biases that have been created in other regions where cultivated meat is seen as a science experiment – not food. Can you tell us about how you are financing this project, and what finance you are hoping to attract going forward?
In addition to internal capital, we have received an Angel Investment from a well-known Biotech Entrepreneur and Investor, Ryan Bethencourt, and one from another Angel investor. We are in the process of raising Pre-Seed funds and negotiating with some interested parties. When do you think that cultivated meat will reach the market, and will your product align with that timing?
We’ve seen that the challenge for cultivated meat companies in most markets worldwide is actually regulatory and food safety compliance and not necessarily anything relating to cell proliferation or scale-up. That said, we plan to have initial products available to higher-end restaurants by the end of 2024, all other things being equal. What about costs? Will your meat be able to compete in cost with animal meat – or how long do you think it will take before this becomes a reality?
The landscape at the moment is not the same as it was, say, 5 years ago. There are varying types of 3rd party providers working on effective and affordable bioreactor, cell culture media, scaffolding, and growth factor solutions and platforms which will help to fast-track the cost-effective development process on our path to a viable product. We’re confident we will achieve price parity with conventional meat products in certain areas of the market within the next 5-10 years. What do you envisage the protein market will look like in the future?
Our blue-sky thinking of the future is that we envision cultivated meat products available in the meat section of a wide range of retail outlets, alongside the existing plethora of fantastic plant-based meat, with remaining meat products from livestock raised on truly free-range farms. If we were to see a shift from a traditional centralised supply chain to a decentralised food system – cultivated animal product producers would be able to adapt by providing DIY solutions to consumers. Open source “brew-it -yourself” kits could make meat accessible for everyone. These could service informal markets throughout the African continent – providing nutrition and opportunities for smaller businesses. What is your vision of the future of our food systems, and how does Mzansi Meat fit into that?
Aside from air, food (including clean water) is probably the most vital resource for life on Earth. When one looks at current food systems data and 2050 population projections, the future does look bleak. But humanity has more knowledge, technology, human capacity and social intelligence than ever before—all of which can be leveraged to create a food system that nourishes all the world’s people, grows emerging economies, and nurtures diverse and thriving ecosystems. Since it is estimated that cultivated meat uses only 20% of the land and 4% of the water that factory-farmed operations do and also only contributes only 26% of the GHG emissions we see the technology and our company contributing positively to these ideals.

10525,SuperMeat Opens ‘World’s First Cultured Chicken Restaurant Experience’ to Tel Aviv Diners,https://vegconomist.com/food-and-beverage/supermeat-opens-worlds-first-cultured-chicken-restaurant-experience-to-tel-aviv-diners/,2020-11-10,"Israeli food-tech startup SuperMeat has opened a test kitchen in Tel Aviv to premier its cultured chicken burgers.  The Chicken offers diners the opportunity to eat meat grown directly from chicken cells, in what SuperMeat claims to be the world’s first consumer experience of its kind.  According to the company, selected customers can be seated at the bar to watch the chefs in action, while tables in the dining room overlook the modern pilot plant where guests can observe the production process. The menu is made up of three courses and the main course options both contain a crispy cultured chicken fillet (see image below), served in a brioche bun. The race to get clean meat to the table already involves a surprising amount of contenders. Israel21 stated in June that thirty cultivated meat startups, five of them Israeli, have emerged over the past seven years. Last month we reported that the EU is subsidising a research program from the Meat4All consortium to the amount of 2.7M Euros, demonstrating that it is committed to cultured meat resolving some of the issues that our food systems have created. Interestingly, back in 2018 the venture arm of poultry giant Tyson Foods co-led a $2.2 million seed round in Jerusalem-based cultured meat food tech, Future Meat Technologies. SuperMeat’s product is still at the development stage and while it is not yet commercial, the test kitchen has been transformed to provide what it refers to as a full cultured meat restaurant experience. SuperMeat says it believes in the need for transparency and to that end it is showcasing the full process of the chicken meat from cell to burger. Fast Company reports that the food has not yet received regulatory approval, as governments are still developing frameworks to deal with the new category of cultured meat (in the U.S., the USDA and FDA are working together on how to regulate the products). However, SuperMeat is able to serve the meat to get feedback while still in development stages. Within one to two years, it hopes to launch in restaurants. In five years, it plans to launch commercial-scale plants, and expects to reach cost parity with traditional meat shortly afterward. SuperMeat is now looking for partners across food and ingredient sourcing industries in order to to work together in the development of high-quality meat products and make cultured meat globally available. Ido Savir, CEO, SuperMeat stated: “The launch of The Chicken is an important step toward a world where cultured meat is accessible to everyone. There is strong public demand for transparency of how food comes to the table. We’re proud to share the full story of SuperMeat chicken for the first time —offering production and dinner all under the same roof, from our plant to your fork.”    "

10556,Soon Less than 42% of Europeans Will Consume Meat & Dairy,https://vegconomist.com/studies-and-numbers/soon-less-than-42-of-europeans-will-consume-meat-dairy/,2020-11-03,"Veganz released its  European Food Report for World Vegan Day yesterday, with more than 2,600 participants from all over Europe. Of the 69.1% of the omnivores, 27.2% can already imagine that in future they will turn to veggie alternatives, meaning that omnivorous lifestyles will be followed by less than 42% of Europeans.  Veganz published an excerpt from the large-scale study on nutritional behaviour in seven European countries. The report asks: how do vegans place particular importance in their shopping and eating habits? To what extent can flexitarians and omnivores imagine living without animal products in the future and what is the acceptance amongst Europeans of cultivated meat, laboratory cheese and insect protein? The number of flexitarians, who deliberately consume meat less frequently, is now 22.9% in Europe. Although only 1.9% of people in Europe eat a vegan and 3.1% a vegetarian diet, 57.1% of European flexitarians can imagine switching to a vegetarian and 7.9% to a vegan diet in the future. Nearly 30% of the Germans interviewed say they would like to adopt a flexitarian diet. The results of the study are therefore in line with other German nutrition studies. Around 24% of European CO2 consumption is attributable to the consumption of animal foods. A flexitarian diet with vegan products can significantly help to minimise the urgently needed overall reduction in the consumption of animal foods. The more flexitarians, the better it is for the environment. The results of the survey among omnivores confirm the trend of Europeans towards a low-meat diet. If you take a look at the results of the study, the appeal is: “Please, more sausage and cheese alternatives and baked goods! A full 45.5% of vegan Europeans (and 50.1% of Germans) miss sausage and cheese and would like to see more choice at the vegan cold cuts counter. In addition, many vegans hope that there will soon be more variety in bakery products (Europeans: 38.6%; Germans: 39.4%).    "

Learn more in YouTube’s privacy policy. Always display content from YouTube Last week I hailed the European Union for investing 2.7 million Euros in bio-tech research for cultivated meat. This week I slam them for being anti-business. This is what they’re up to: Members of the European Parliament have voted to prohibit any reference to dairy terms on plant-based products, including adjectives like creamy, yogurt-style, cheese substitute. They also want to prohibit packing traditionally used for dairy packaging like butter blocks and cartons. My business bottom line here: I eat peanut butter. I do not think it is dairy. I also use moisturizing cream. I’m not confused. I don’t eat it and I also don’t think it’s dairy. Members of the European parliament look desperate because they can’t compete, despite subsidies, with the changing consumer behavior patterns and that is away from dairy and towards plant-based dairy and milk. They look anti-consumer and anti-commerce. Luckily Mickey Mouse may be smarter than the European Union and its Members of the European Parliament. Former CEO and current Chief Executive of the Board of Disney, Robert Iger, has joined the board of Perfect Day.

10564,"World’s Only Public Cultivated Meat Company, MeaTech 3D, Files for IPO in USA",https://vegconomist.com/trade/worlds-only-public-cultivated-meat-company-meat-tech-3d-files-for-ipo-in-usa/,2020-11-02,"MeaTech 3D, an Israeli company working on developing 3D-printed cultivated meat, has announced that it is filing for a US IPO. The company has already been traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange for a year, making it the world’s only public cultivated meat company.  MeaTech submitted its draft registration statement confidentially, and neither the number of shares nor their price have yet been revealed. Unlike many other cultivated meat companies, MeaTech does not plan to launch its own brand. Instead, it intends to be a B2B company, aiding other companies in industrial-scale production of cultured meat. After patenting its technology, the company will license it to manufacturers. MeaTech successfully printed a piece of cultured beef in August, and launched a company aimed at developing cultured chicken in September. Just last week, Meat-Tech announced it planned to acquire Peace of Meat, a Belgian company producing cultured animal fat. It has already invested €1M in the company and will fully acquire it over the course of two years, subject to a final agreement. The company is also creating a subsidiary working on cultured fish, and aims to 3D print a larger piece of meat in 2021. Currently, the company has no products on the market, and it estimates that none will be available for at least six years. According to Meat-Tech, it is targeting the US as its primary market, which explains why it has filed for an IPO in the country. Currently, there are no public cultured meat companies in the US, but JUST has hinted that it is considering an IPO. The company is working on cultured chicken as well as its plant-based egg alternative.    "

10591,New Alliance Formed Between the ProVeg New Food Conference & Anuga for 2021,https://vegconomist.com/fairs-and-events/new-alliance-formed-between-the-proveg-new-food-conference-anuga-for-2021/,2020-10-27,"The New Food Conference focuses on the fast-moving developments in the plantbased industry and was held for the first time in 2019 to provide a platform for international representatives and innovative pioneers to exchange ideas and to further promote the development of alternative proteins including cellular agriculture.  “Cellular Agriculture start-ups around the world have long been the focus of attentive investors and their products are being traded as an essential part of our future food supply. Cellular agriculture means producing animal products without the numerous problematic consequences of conventional animal husbandry. “Cultivated proteins have an enormous potential to satisfy the growing hunger of the world population for animal products in a resource-saving way”, says Katleen Haefele, Head of Food Services & Events at ProVeg. She adds: “We are very pleased to have a strong partner in Anuga at our side, with whom we can jointly advance innovation and future topics. The cooperation with the leading food trade fair once again places alternative proteins at the heart of the food industry”. In addition to cellular agriculture, fermentation processes and the possibility of hybrid products from plant and cell-cultivated components will also be the subject of the conference. The event in Cologne is thus the perfect complement to the New Food Conference in Berlin in April 2021, which will focus on developments in the rapidly growing market for plant proteins. The New Food Conference in Berlin will take place as a hybrid format with a digital platform, making the topic accessible to a more international audience. Tickets for both events, the New Food Conference in Berlin and the New Food Conference in Cologne, are already available on the website. “Vegetable foods and alternative proteins are experiencing a real boom – not only as meat alternatives, but as an elementary component of health and fitness. At Anuga, too, we are seeing a stronger increase in the number of exhibitors in this segment year after year. We are therefore very pleased that, for the first time together with ProVeg, we are focusing even more strongly on this topic at the New Food Conference at Anuga 2021. As the world’s largest trade fair for food and beverages and as a trend and innovation platform, we can thus provide important impulses with regard to key future topics of the industry,” explains Stefanie Mauritz, Director Anuga.

Always display content from YouTube Get With The Program Speaking of investing, the European Union has invested 2.7 million Euros in cultured meat bio-tech research, showing that Brussels is indeed on board with cultured meat. (Doubters among us, get with the program! It’s the future.) The funds of the 2.7 million euros will go to scale up cultured meat production, and work on market acceptance and performance safety asset tests to allow the industrialization and commercialization of cultured meat. My business bottom line here is that veg tech, and by that I mean the research into plant-based proteins, fermented proteins, and cultured meat, has now become an issue of national security. I just wrote about this in vegconomist magazine. Canada is investing, the EU is investing, even China is looking at reducing its meat consumption. The U.S. would do well to get with the program. Powering Up the VegEconomy Since many of you are already with the program, you want to help power up the VegEconomy. Now that is easier than ever. There is a new online directory platform called vKind that indeed connects the veg-curious, the plant-based, and the vegan with businesses that share their values and align with their life principles. Co-founder, Michon Javelosa, had this to say in vegconomist, “We aim to power up the VegEconomy by cultivating an economic ecosystem where consumers can align their purchasing decisions with businesses and brands that share their values. It’s a powerful win-win proposition.” My business bottom line is this: Of course, we vote on November 3rd. However, really, we vote every time we use our credit card. So, if you align your dollars and your purchasing power – and you are oh, so powerful! – with your values, you will indeed see a change in the world. Check out vkind.com.

10611,Replacing Just 10% of Animal Ag With Plant-Based Would Save Land Equivalent to Size of Germany,https://vegconomist.com/environment/replacing-just-10-of-animal-ag-with-plant-based-would-save-land-equivalent-to-size-of-germany/,2020-10-22,"A study commissioned by Blue Horizon with PriceWaterhouse Coopers reveals that if 10% of the global animal market was replaced by plant-based products, by 2030 we could save CO2 emissions equivalent to 2.7 billion trees – an area of land bigger than Germany, and enough water for everyone in the state of New York for five years.  The environmental footprint of beef mince production is most striking: the impact of alternative protein is 15x lower than conventionally farmed beef. Global meat production and consumption increase year by year. Consumption per capita is higher than ever before. For the next decade, the growth trend is expected to continue, driven by Asia, albeit at a lower rate. The burden of meat production on the environment is massive. The comprehensive study by Blue Horizon Corporation, with the support of PWC, shows for the first time the ecological impacts in a consistent framework across different meat categories and geographies. Also, it includes the monetisation of environmental costs to show the scale of impact and enable impacts to be compared and consolidated. The analysis illustrates that plant-based alternative protein sources have a much lower environmental impact. Variation is considerable, depending on location and farming system. The monetisation of the related costs shows a clear picture: On average, one kilo of conventionally farmed beef generates environmental costs of no less than USD 7.26. This contrasts with costs of only USD 0.48 per kilo for its plant-based alternative. For chicken and pork, the gap is smaller but still significant:  USD 1.66 compared to USD 0.30 per kilo for poultry and USD 0.72 versus USD 0.21 for pig meat. Global consumption of meat reached 385 million tonnes in 2018. According to the analysis, this accounts for at least 1.7 gigatonnes CO2 emissions, occupies 380 million hectares of land and requires almost 87 billion m3 of water to produce. By looking at the potential impacts of switching away from animal products to more sustainable alternatives, the study delivers impressive facts and figures. The study finds that by 2030, with a 10% switch to plant-based alternatives, 176 million CO2 emissions could be avoided, 38 million hectares of land could be freed and 8.6 billion m3 water saved per year. In other words: If 10% of the global animal market was replaced by alternative plant-based products, by 2030 we could expect to save CO2 emissions  equivalent to 2.7 billion trees, an area of land bigger than Germany, and enough water for everyone in the state of New York for five years. The environmental footprint of plant-based alternatives has proved to be significantly lower than their animal counterparts. The strongest gap can be observed for beef mince. Here the impact of alternative protein is 15x lower than conventionally farmed beef, followed by chicken, with a 5.5x higher impact, and pork at 3.4. Even for egg, the animal-based product with the lowest environmental footprint, the impact of the alternative is more than 3x lower than conventionally farmed egg. On average across the products, greenhouse gases account for around a third of the impact. Land use accounts for just over half of the environmental footprint while water consumption makes up the smallest proportion of the impact. Björn Witte, CEO of Blue Horizon, comments: “This study provides detailed and robust information about the true price of consumption of animal proteins and their vegetable alternatives. This work is an important step in helping people to understand how the decisions we make about our protein consumption impact our environment. In addition, it enables investors to better assess the market opportunities in the food 4.0 sector.”   Figure 1: Valued environmental impact of animal products and plant-based alternatives Considerable effects on land use, GHG emissions and water consumption Worldwide, around 38% of habitable land is used for industrial animal agriculture, equivalent in size to the United States, Russia, China and India combined. In terms of water, 16% of freshwater withdrawals every year go to animal agriculture, while in the area of global greenhouse gas emissions 14% comes from industrial animal agriculture in the process of food digestion. In contrast, plant-based protein alternatives are not only animal-free, but also require significantly less resources in all three categories. The quantified results of the study show that in the case of land use, plant-based alternatives are between 33% and 91% less land-intensive. Impact is most significant for beef with a potential reduction of 91%, while for pork it is lowest at 33%. In terms of location, Brazilian beef farming has by far the largest footprint, which is mostly attributable to the social costs associated with the large areas of land deforested from the Amazon for cattle farms. With regard to greenhouse gas emissions, plant-based meat is 69-92% less intensive. Impact is most significant for beef with 92%. Pork and chicken have an equally high potential at 89% and 88% respectively. Egg comes at the end with a still high potential of 69%.  Looking at water consumption, the data show that plant-based protein similarly less resource-intensive. Results vary between 95% in the case of eggs and 53% for beef. Chicken (-82%) and pork (-84%) also show considerable potential. Chinese farming systems have the highest savings potential when shifting their population to a plant-based diet as they use much more water per kg of egg compared to Europe and the US.  Figure 2: Variation in environmental impact of animal by location (predominant farming system) Note: in Brazil, the predominant beef farming system is a grazing system. For all other locations and products, the predominant system is conventional. Plant-based alternatives prove to be a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative Overall, the environmental footprint of plant-based alternatives has proved to be significantly lower than their animal counterparts across all products, locations, and farming systems. Although there is much less variation in the impact between plant-based alternatives compared to animal products, there are still some significant differences – ranging from $0.18 to $0.60 of impact per kg. Variation between the environmental impact of alternatives is primarily caused by the choice of protein substitute ingredient included in the recipe, which can make up by weight anything from 15 to 45% of the product. Additionally, where oils make up a large proportion of the recipe, the environmental footprint can increase significantly. Greenhouse gas emissions per product can vary from 1.4t CO2/t (protein isolates) to 3.7t CO2/t (protein concentrates). The more highly processed an ingredient, the higher the GHG emissions produced. The lowest land use is those of mung bean protein isolates (0.05ha) while isolated proteins (0.81ha) and textured vegetable proteins (0.78ha) use most surface. The variation in water consumption is also considerable, ranging from only 61m3 for mung bean protein isolates to 309m3 for soy protein isolates. About the study The study “Environmental impacts of animal and plant-based food” provides an evidence base to explore and compare the environmental impacts of both animal products and their plant-based alternatives. Globally, cattle, poultry, and pig products make up almost 95% of global meat production. Over 82 million tonnes of eggs are produced annually. The study therefore measures the environmental impacts of chicken, egg, pork, and beef production impacts across geographies and farming systems and compares these impacts to substitutes produced using plant-based protein alternatives. The focus lies on the exhaustive evaluation of environmental impacts from meat production and it does not include other factors such as air pollutants, water pollutants, and waste.    "
10613,Veronica Fil: Australia’s Vegan Market is Heating Up,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/veronica-fil-australias-vegan-market-is-heating-up/,2020-10-22,"Guys, I told you. The Aussie vegan market is about to get huge. With the country’s borders closed, high-potential startups have had no choice but to bunker down and build their businesses on home soil.  It’s put a much-needed plug in the country’s ‘brain drain’; suddenly, all that talent is staying put rather than scooting overseas to explore (what’s perceived to be) bigger opportunities. At the same time, issues around food security and animal agriculture have become a topic of household conversation, and that mainstream awareness has led to accelerated growth in the domestic plant-based sector. While the industry was already starting to gain momentum prior to covid, this new global climate has seriously sped up the process. We’ve been seeing more and more positive, plant-based news come out of Australia in recent months—such as Fenn Foods’ announcement of going carbon neutral, and research suggesting that Australia is now the second most popular country in the world for veganism. This past week was no different: Could it be that the great down-underdog is finally realising its potential as a global player in the plant-based economy? In terms of market size, the country’s still small in comparison to say, the UK or US. But due to its geographical proximity to Asia—a region where the alternative protein market is going bezerk—it’s becoming a hotbed of opportunity for food startups and hungry VCs alike. And believe me: investors are taking notice. In the past week alone, I’ve been contacted by three different investors doing due diligence on Australian plant-based startups—a clear indication that VCs are getting ready to bite. Fortunately, the locals are used to swimming with sharks. It’s been one year since my partner and I left Australia to launch our own plant-based company in the USA. At the time we wondered how many years it would take for the Aussie market to catch up, and for consumer demand to reach a level that justified us bringing our products back home. Suddenly I think it could be a lot sooner than we expected.    "
10615,Elysabeth Alfano: Is VegTech an Issue of National Security?,https://vegconomist.com/society/elysabeth-alfano-is-vegtech-an-issue-of-national-security/,2020-10-21,"According to the United Nations, the world population is going from 7.6 billion people on the planet to roughly 9.8 billion people by 2050.  However, with the almost 30% increase in people, we’re not getting more land and we’re not getting more water.  In fact, with climate change, we are expected to have less habitable and arable land and conditions than currently available. Meat and dairy are known to be land and water-intensive, inefficient business models that require the most precious of resources: land, trees (trees which take carbon from the air are cut to grow grain to mostly feed the 77 billion land animals before slaughter), water and time, all the while putting forth disease in the form of pandemics, heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, furthering their cost.  In a bizarre twist of inefficiency, the grain that is grown, which has protein and fiber, could just be used to feed people leaving many of the trees in place.  Instead, that grain is given to animals.  As shared with me by the Good Food Institute from the World Resources Institute, at best, chicken results in 1 calorie of food for every 9 calories of grain.  This equation is much worse for cows with estimates at 30-40 calories of grain for every 1 calorie of food.   Hardly a business deal anyone would sign up for. Further, the believed to be meat-borne Covid-19 has been devasting for the global food supply, leaving many, an estimated 14 million,  in Latin America and the Caribbean and around the world with food shortages and insecurity. As countries start to plan ahead (or not in some cases) for more mouths to feed and a more efficient way to do it, it is interesting to see which countries are investing, as an interest of national security, in VegTech: research into plant-based options, fermented cells and microbes, and cellular agriculture. Just this week it was revealed that Brussels has invested 2.7 million Euros into cultured meat through the Meat4All programme. Many governments are beginning to be mildly proactive to protect themselves from the food insecurity that meat and dairy create.  As reported by this site, Canada announced earlier this year that it would invest $100M in its plant-based industry and the European Union announced it would invest 10 billion Euros in a green transition with a focus on plant-based proteins. Still, there is much more to be done. For countries which naturally have food insecurity issues, finding a more efficient way to produce food is imperative. Singapore provides only 10% of its own food and imports the rest. This makes its food supply very susceptible to pandemics and regional political squabbles.  Due to the same, Singapore is emerging as the food tech capital, investing $72 billion to prepare for the effects of the current climate crisis, according to vegconomist. The abillionveg app is a social impact vegan food and product review platform. It was founded by Vikas Garg, a recent guest on the Plantbased Business Hour, and is headquartered in Singapore. “There’s no place like Singapore when it comes to government support for entrepreneurs. The country has a unique mission of “30 by 30”; to locally produce 30% of its nutritional needs by 2030. This creates a strong foundation for startups and opportunities from fundraising to production and logistics.” According to the World Bank, China’s arable land was under 13% in 2016 and shrinking.   Thus, the country is dependent on the rest of the world to feed its 1.4 billion people. This puts it in a very difficult position in trade talks because it can never take too hard of a stance when its opponent controls its food supply.  If I were the Chinese government, I would be very seriously promoting Omnipork as a national point of pride and technological advancement, and investing deeply in fermented proteins and cultivated meat. David Yeung, CEO of Green Monday, maker of Omnipork, had this to say about the rising health issues in China due to diet in a recent interview on the Plantbased Business Hour. “The health care burden is enormous and becoming worse and worse… the side effects are hitting China head-on and it exposes the animal farming industry. Not that long ago, not so much meat was consumed, but now suddenly they need to feed so many people with so much meat. [Now we have] African Swine Fever, Avian Flu- I don’t even know how many times it has occurred- and then, of course, this gigantic crisis called Coronavirus. [These diseases] all come from food. They all have a deep correlation to the food industry, in particular the meat and dairy industry. I think now, with the crisis, China has no choice but to re-examine in a very deep way just what should be the sustainable way to feed the country and  how to avoid getting into this [type of] huge crisis that we’re in right now [in the future.]” It will be interesting to see China’s investment strategy as food, land and water become paramount to any nation’s leadership and any government’s survival. China has committed to a 50% reduction in meat consumption and is supportive of foreign and local investment in plant-based alternatives.  At the same time, it is also encouraging foreign investment in livestock and poultry breeding. It may be the private sector that in the end, and often per usual, makes the most impact. The private sector has seemingly come alive at the wheel, investing, in the first half of 2020 alone, $1.5 Billion in VegTech/Alt Proteins.  Private investors see the writing and dollar signs on the wall.  Their interest in plant-based investing is only just ramping up and showing no signs of slowing. In fact, Q1 of 2020 revealed more investment in the plant-based arena than all of 2019. Governments poised to last into the 22nd century would be wise to invest more and at a much faster pace.

10621,MeaTech Invests €1M In Belgium’s Peace of Meat as Part of Full Acquisition,https://vegconomist.com/science/meat-tech-invests-e1m-in-belgiums-peace-of-meat-as-part-of-full-acquisition/,2020-10-21,"MeaTech 3D Ltd, a developer of industrial-scale cultivated meat production technologies based on advanced 3D bioprinting, announces it has made an initial €1M investment in Belgian cultured fat startup Peace of Meat, as part of a planned full acquisition. Peace of Meat has developed a unique, proprietary, stem-cell-based technology to produce animal fats, such as those from cattle, chicken or geese without harming any animals. In 2020 POM was awarded a subsidy of €1.2 million (US$1.33 million) from the Flemish government as part of the €3.6 million Foieture project. The acquisition of the remainder of the company remains subject to the completion of a final agreement. Upon completion of the final agreement and, as POM achieves pre-agreed technological milestones over the course of two years, MeaTech will purchase all of POM’s equity for a total of approximately $17.5 million, for a combination of cash and Meat-Tech equity.  MeaTech expects to leverage POM’s cultured fat technologies to expand its cell-based offerings by accelerating cultured fat development and shortening times to market. Peace of Meat has already held tasting events demonstrating the potential of cultured fats to enhance plant-based protein products. Such products are being called hybrid products as they are made of both plant based and cultured animal cell ingredients. “MeaTech believes that hybrid products, such as plant-based burgers made with cultured fat, may prove to be an exciting new product category. Such fats may offer improved aromas, flavors and textures as compared to purely plant-based proteins. Completing this acquisition will add technological capabilities to support Meat-Tech’s core center-of-plate product offering.” added Steve H. Lavin, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Meat-Tech. “POM shares the strategic vision of Meat-Tech 3D and is excited to join forces. We are convinced that the strong scientific and commercial synergies between both parties paired with our approach of creating hybrid products based on savory cultured fats is the perfect setting to bring cultured meat to market in an increasingly competitive space” said David Brandes, Managing Director of Peace of Meat.

Meat4All’s goal is to scale up cultured meat production technology, work on market acceptance and perform safety assessment tests to allow the industrialization and commercialization of cultured meat. Commenting in a statement, Iñigo Charola, CEO of BioTech Foods, said: “It is hugely satisfying for the entire team at BioTech Foods, and for our partners at Organotechnie, to obtain this backing from the European Union for our ‘Meat4All’ project. This is the first time that Europe has effectively committed to cultured meat. Cultured meat will be a key ingredient of our future diet, and now we have it confirmed also by the institutions.”    "
10625,Dao Foods Announces 1st Cohort of Plant-Based Ventures Set to Change Food in China,https://vegconomist.com/startups/dao-foods-announces-1st-cohort-of-plant-based-ventures-set-to-change-food-in-china/,2020-10-20,"Dao Foods International has revealed its first cohort of Chinese plant-based startup ventures under its Dao Foods Incubator initiative. As we reported earlier this month, the China-focused Dao Foods had announced that its China Venture Fund will invest in 30 Next-Gen Good Food Ventures over the next three years.  The announcement was made at the third China NextGen Good Food Bootcamp which was held in Shanghai, where Dao Foods has convened various stakeholders including entrepreneurs and investors, to discuss and inspire sustainable development of the alternative protein sector in China. Kitchen 70/30 A Shanghai-based food delivery venture that works on plant-based takeaway food that would appeal to China’s younger-generation mainstream consumers in terms of both taste and health. Fresh Foods A Shenzhen-based venture that has been working on its proprietary plant-based yogurt for years and potentially other dairy products. Raw Plant-Based A Beijing-based venture that is focused on developing plant-based, organic smoothie products for younger-generation mainstream consumers. WOW Foods A Beijing-based venture that works on plant-based functional protein drinks particularly for children ages 6-12. Aside from early-stage seed capital, over the coming six months Dao Foods will be providing these incubator companies with customized training and mentoring from its international and China-based network of experts and mentors, particularly, how to make plant-based products more appealing to mainstream Chinese consumers. Albert Tseng, a co-founder of Dao Foods International commented: “We believe that the growth we have witnessed in alternative protein sector in the U.S. over the last few years will soon be repeated in China and are excited to work with New Crop Capital, Matrix Partners and other visionary and impact-oriented investors to accelerate investment in China focused entrepreneurs who aim to increase the availability of great-tasting plant-based and alternative protein products in China.” Tao Zhang, also co-founder of Dao Foods, further stated: “The alternative protein sector is still quite nascent in China, and the mainstream consumer awareness of plant-based alternatives is not fully there yet. We are hoping that an army of entrepreneurs can be nurtured and developed from the Dao Foods Incubator where we will be providing intensive and structured mentoring to these next-gen food entrepreneurs, so Dao Foods can work with them together to successfully scale up the alternative protein sector for the long term.” See our reporter Elysabeth Alfano’s interview with the Dao Foods co- founders, in July this summer, here.

It is further announced that Eat Just and Proterra are also in discussions to focus as an alliance on the commercial production of cultured meat.  The new Eat Just subsidiary created by the partnership will be known as Eat Just Asia and will serve JUST Egg manufacturing and distribution partners across Asia. Perhaps coincidentally; on the same day that Impossible Foods also announces plans in the Singaporean market prior to its intended entrance into China, JUST says that the Proterra consortium will invest up to USD $100 million and Eat Just will invest up to USD $20 million in order to establish its largest-ever production facility in Singapore. The press release also states plans of the partnership to focus on cultured meat: “Outside the scope of their JUST Egg protein partnership, Eat Just and Proterra Asia are in discussions to expand their alliance to focus on another promising avenue for protein innovation — the commercial production of cultured meat. Both companies believe cultured meat, in addition to plant-based food products, can help create a safer, more secure global food supply and they look forward to exploring future phases of their relationship.” Says Josh Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of Eat Just: “This partnership will further accelerate our path to become one of the world’s largest producers of eggs in the next decade. Proterra’s experience across sourcing and manufacturing will be invaluable. Consumer demand, driven by health, food security and food safety, is creating an environment of extraordinary opportunity for this unique partnership,” Upon construction, this initial factory will generate thousands of metric tons of protein, with additional future facilities also envisaged for Asia as the demand for protein in the region increases to hundreds of thousands of tons, creating additional jobs and infrastructure.  “Proterra is excited to announce this collaboration to form a strategic alliance with Eat Just for Asia; we would like to help consumers across Asia get better access to the excellent plant-based egg product by establishing a fully integrated supply chain within Eat Just Asia,” said Tai Lin, Managing Partner of Proterra Asia.   “It is increasingly important for us to invest in novel sustainable agri-food technologies, such as alternative proteins, to meet the world’s future needs for food and nutrition. The partnership between Eat Just and Proterra is an important addition to Singapore’s agri-food ecosystem and will build new innovation and production capabilities within the sector here. This will allow us to better cater to the needs of the Asian markets, while creating exciting opportunities for Singapore,” said Damian Chan, Executive Vice President of the Singapore Economic Development Board.

Help Us Get Business Onside”",https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/richard-parr-mbe-managing-director-of-gfi-europe-want-to-change-the-food-system-help-us-get-business-onside/,2020-10-16,"It’s not often that environmental, animal welfare and consumer nonprofits team up with business. But in recent weeks, companies from Unilever to IKEA, as well as leading NGOs such as WWF and Greenpeace, have taken a stand for Europe’s thriving plant-based sector.  They called on Members of the European Parliament to reject plans to ban companies from using everyday terms like burger, steak and sausage to describe their plant-based products. Faced with a proposal that undermines the EU’s climate commitments and defies the wishes of consumers, businesses and nonprofits found common ground. For The Good Food Institute Europe (GFI Europe), this initiative isn’t a one-off. We’re working to build a healthier, more sustainable and more humane food system by accelerating Europe’s transition from conventional animal products to plant-based, fermentation-derived and cultivated meat, eggs, dairy and seafood. We’re a nonprofit, but we believe in the potential of markets to drive change – and now, we’re hiring a Corporate Engagement Manager in Europe to expand our work with businesses. We’re on a mission to make plant-based and cultivated proteins the cheapest, tastiest and most convenient options – so that they become the default choice for consumers. The incredible success of plant-based companies, from Quorn to the Vegetarian Butcher, is already drawing the attention of the conventional meat industry. Around the world, meat industry players like Tyson are reinventing themselves as protein companies, while companies like Nestlé are investing heavily in plant-based innovation. In the UK just last week, chicken restaurant Nando’s launched plant-based peri-peri.  The rise of specialised plant-based companies is always exciting, but when the world’s biggest providers of animal products begin to realign their business models, it’s game-changing. Most demand for new plant-based products isn’t driven by vegans and vegetarians – it’s driven by meat-eaters looking for more sustainable, healthy and just versions of their favourite foods.  Recruiting a Corporate Engagement Manager will increase GFI Europe’s engagement with leading companies to help accelerate this exciting transition. Our new recruit will work with companies at all stages of the production process, from entrepreneurs to established multinationals. Drawing on business expertise and market insights, they’ll encourage and support the development of new plant-based foods and help get existing products onto restaurant menus and supermarket shelves. The most effective way to transform Europe’s food system is to provide the food people love, made in healthier, more sustainable and more humane ways. If you believe in the power of business to deliver change, join us in building a sustainable, healthy and just food system.  For enquiries about The Good Food Institute Europe’s Corporate Engagement Manager role, please reach out to Alex Mayers, Head of Operations for GFI Europe, on alexm@gfi.org.    "

The aim of the summit, which was conducted online, was to make plans for a future where protein is supplied sustainably, tackling malnutrition and creating numerous jobs. During the summit, participants made some exciting announcements regarding the future of alt-protein in India. Rajeev Chitrabhanu, the former chief of Morgan Stanley in India, announced he would support and fund alt protein startups in India in conjunction with GFI India. He hopes to expand this initiative across Asia. “Many of these developments [in alt-protein] are centred on the U.S. and EU, and there is a dearth of support for the industry in Asia,” he said. “With this platform, I’m aiming to empower great entrepreneurs to attain huge scale with the right mentorship and partnerships.” Meanwhile, Sandeep Singh of pharmaceutical company Alkem Labs announced the launch of his plant-based meat company Blue Tribe Foods, along with his wife Niki. The company showcased its progress on Day 3 of the summit. Along with industry partners, GFI India introduced an alternative protein industry forum, supported by the World Economic Forum. It hopes to address bottlenecks in the availability of equipment in the alt-protein sector. The aim is to help stakeholders in the industry to collaborate, through a simple platform with no obligations or financial commitments. Finally, The Good Food Institute said it would be collaborating with the World Sustainability Organization’s Friend of the Sea project to launch sustainability certifications for plant-based seafood. “Plant-based seafood has a big role to play in alt protein and restaurants and buyers are relying on certification to make purchasing decisions,” said Jen Lamy, Sustainable Seafood Manager at GFI. “Earning the FOTS [Friend of the Sea] logo will help plant-based companies get in front of people making purchasing decisions in retail and restaurants.”    "
10666,Plant-Based Meat Brands are Slashing Prices — Is Price Parity Finally Here?,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/plant-based-meat-brands-are-slashing-prices-is-price-parity-finally-here/,2020-10-12,"For years, there has been a disparity between the prices of vegan meats and conventional animal-based products. But now, there are signs that the tide is finally starting to turn. Most recently, US brand Before the Butcher has released a new line of burgers priced similarly to meat-based burgers.  Before the Butcher‘s Mainstream Plant-Based Patties are available to retail and foodservice providers at a low wholesale price, with a suggested retail price of under $1.40 per patty. In contrast, many plant-based burgers cost as much as $3 per patty. The company has managed to reduce costs by making slight changes to ingredients and packing in bulk. Many people cite the comparative expense of plant-based products as a reason why they can’t go vegan. As a result, a growing number of companies are trying to address this problem. Beyond Meat has repeatedly stated that it is aiming for price parity. Over the summer, it released a limited edition discount pack of burgers working out at $1.60 each. The company has said that it hopes to underprice animal protein by 2025. It is looking into alternative protein sources to help it cut costs. In Canada, Beyond has just released a bulk pack of its Mild Italian sausages at 100 Costco stores across the country. The new pack reduces the price per sausage to CAD$1.67, making them significantly more affordable. Beyond’s competitor Impossible Foods has also succeeded in dropping prices due to increasing economies of scale. The company says its goal has always been to “drive down prices through economies of scale, reach price parity, and then undercut the price of conventional ground beef from cows.” Meanwhile, JUST Egg has lowered prices with the aim of becoming one of the most affordable plant-based proteins on the market. In the wake of Covid-19, the price of conventional meat has soared in many areas, and sales of plant-based alternatives have risen due to health and environmental concerns. While vegan price parity may not yet be universal, it’s beginning to look inevitable that plant protein will underprice animal protein in the near future. “More consumers clearly are interested in meat alternatives, but until now plant-based meats have had a price tag that doesn’t fit many family budgets. We are opening the category to a large new universe of purchasers that we expect to drive substantial new growth for alt-meat products,” says Danny O’Malley, Founder and President of Before the Butcher.

Here is the rundown from her video for the week ending October 4, 2020.  TechCrunch reports that $1.5 billion dollars was raised for alt proteins in the first half of 2020 alone. We might expect this for plant-based proteins. We might expect this for even cell cultured technology. What might surprise people is that fermented proteins is a big part of this large raise. From the Good Food Institute, Liz Specht has this to say, ‘Fermentation is powering a new wave of alternative protein products, with huge potential for improving flavor, sustainability, and production efficiency. Innovators and investors are recognizing this market potential, leading to a surge of activity in fermentation as an enabling platform for the alternative protein industry as a whole.’ Click here to display content from YouTube.

But fermented proteins are now going to make their way into products and onto grocery store shelves sooner than you think, starting with Perfect Day’s Brave Robot.  Stay tuned for the Plantbased Business Hour interview with CEO/Co-Founder Ryan of Perfect Day on November 10. Nestle’s back in the news. They are saying that their plant-based products are up forty percent. CEO Mark Schneider has this to say, ‘People have a renewed interest in personal health and losing weight as Covid particularly affects those with pre-existing health conditions.’ My business bottom line here is that Covid has forced people to advocate for their own health. Because of this, meat and dairy has lost customers such that when and if Covid is ever over, they will never see them again. In 2019 an independent think tank, Rethink X, said that by 2030 meat and dairy would be all but dead. Everybody declared it was ‘vegan fantasyland’ but recently at an alt protein conference, Ryan Bethencourt, founder of Wild Earth vegan pet food and a frequent guest on the Plantbased Business Hour, he had this to say, ‘It is becoming increasingly obvious to investors, startups making products from plants, cultured animal cells and microbes, and the world’s leading meat and dairy companies, that there are more efficient and sustainable ways to feed people.” My business bottom line: we don’t use typewriters. I don’t ride in a horse and buggy, and Covid or no Covid, we have turned a corner and we are never going back to meat and dairy. This has been the Plantbased Business Minute. If you would like a deeper dive into the plant-based business world, please check out my podcast, the Plantbased Business Hour. And, of course, if you are a small vegan company or a large meat and dairy corporation and you are looking to navigate the plant-based landscape, you can, of course, reach out to me on LinkedIn. Until I see you again next week, together we’re taking back our health, the health of the planet, and the health of our bottom line.” Elysabeth Alfano is a Plant-based Marketing/Communications Consultant, Consulting Managing Director of vegconomist, North America and the host of the Plantbased Business Hour.

The event will be held as a video conference and gathers the leading food experts from across the world to analyze rapid developments that are transforming the food industry.  The Food Innovation Summit will focus on two promising areas: plant-based products and cultivated meat. Over the past decade, the health and environmentally conscious consumer segment has grown rapidly. This rapid growth has led to an equally impressive response from private actors: several companies see the plant-based and cultivated products as a  sustainable solution to global problems while also turning a profit. Large Investments show a clear sign of the booming sector. For example, venture capitalists already invested more than $1.1 billion into alternative protein sources in the first half of 2020. This investment is double those made during 2019. A Chance to Learn from the Best The Food Innovation Summit will present the latest trends, newest technologies, and largest growth factors. The keynote speaker is David Kay – the Senior Manager of Communications from the US-based Memphis Meats. He represents a start-up that grows beef, chicken, and duck from cells and will most likely be the first company to bring cultivated meat to the market. Memphis Meats investors include the meat production giants such as Tyson Foods and Cargill and well-known philanthropists Bill Gates and Richard Branson. The conference will also feature presentations from Oatly, Unilever, Gold&Green, ProVeg, and many more. “There’s no doubt the alternative protein market is going to grow exponentially in the future. The only question is which companies have the ability to profit from these trends the most,” Anna Kaplina, the main organizer of the Food Innovation Summit, stated.

With this latest move, the impact investor is making progress with its plans to lay the foundation for a plant-based industry in China as discussed in an interview with vegconomist in May.  Dao Foods is a key player in the new protein revolution which is gradually undergoing in China; the company has not only invested in the fastest-growing Chinese plant-based startup, Starfield, which recently received $10 million in investment funding, but also set up its Dao Foods Incubator to support entrepreneurs in the alternative protein sector and demonstrate the far-reaching opportunities it offers for China. Dao Foods Venture Fund 1, including leading Chinese investors like VC firm Matrix Partners China, was established to support and invest in 30 China-focused alternative protein and cell-based product ventures. Aside from early stage seed capital, Dao Foods also plans to provide incubator companies with in-kind support and mentoring, especially in terms of how to make plant-based products more appealing to mainstream meat-eaters. Though Dao Foods anticipates that most of the Incubator companies will be China-based entrepreneurs, it also plans on recruiting a small number of international ventures that have prioritized China as a key part of their market strategy. According to Dao Foods, the success of the American plant-based market, in particular the historic IPO success of Beyond Meat, where its stock prices soared 163% on the first day, was a wake-up call for the Chinese investment community. While two years ago it was still difficult to talk to investors, this has now changed fundamentally. “We believe that the growth we have witnessed in alternative protein sector in the U.S. over the last few years will soon be repeated in China and are excited to work with New Crop Capital, Matrix Partners and other visionary and impact-oriented investors to accelerate investment in China-focused entrepreneurs who aim to increase the availability of great-tasting plant-based and alternative protein products in China,” said Albert Tseng, co-founder of Dao Foods International.

From today, PHW will be offering five vegan sausage products and six meat and fish alternatives for the fresh food sector aiming specifically at flexitarians. “Our new Green Legend products create a taste experience that comes very close to the original. All of them correspond to the latest generation of plant-based products. We are positioning ourselves as a supplier of high-quality protein products. Our credo has always been ‘growth through diversity’. In addition to a range of poultry specialities, we have also been offering our own vegan products since 2015, which are now ideally complemented by the new plant-based products,” says Marcus Keitzer, PHW Board Member for Alternative Protein Sources. Green Legend will offer five types of vegan sausage: vegan poultry mortadella, vegan poultry mortadella paprika, vegan poultry salami, vegan poultry meat sausage, and vegan poultry wiener. In the fresh food section, there will be vegan meat mini-burgers, vegan chicken mini-schnitzels, vegan chicken pastry nuggets, vegan chicken sticks, vegan fish sticks and vegan fish pastry nuggets. The company states that the vegan products are without added soy, flavour enhancers, palm fat and coconut oil and that they are based on peas, field beans, corn and wheat. “About 42 million people in Germany are flexitarians. There are many reasons why people fall back on alternative products. But one thing is certain: the overall market for meat replacement products is booming. In the first half of 2020 sales rose by 64.9% compared to the same period last year – we still see a lot of potential in this market segment,” explains Dr Ingo Stryck, Marketing Director at WIESENHOF.

The Bright Green Partners team consists of ex-strategy consultants (e.g. ex-Kearney, ex-McKinsey, ex-Bain) and senior freelancers with a focus on science, engineering and business from around the world – all with project experience on plant-, fermentation- and cell-based products and markets. Speaking with vegconomist today, Managing Partners Gerrit, Geza and Floor, commented: “Individuals and organizations are increasingly overwhelmed by the complexity in plant-, fermentation- and cell-based products and markets. They face several challenges to cut through that complexity to determine their individual path to commercial success. “This was the rationale to establish Bright Green Partners as the global leading plant and cell tech strategy boutique helping organizations to win in these new markets. Today, we work with several leading organizations around the world on innovation scouting, strategy re-assessments, market entries, M&A transaction support, business transformations and other projects to create a brighter future for them.”          “Our clients are large corporations as well as small-and-medium-sized-businesses around the world in sectors like agriculture, food and feed, materials / machinery manufacturing, chemicals, biotechnology, wholesale, retail and services. We also work for investors (e.g. venture capital or private equity) and governments. In line with large management consultancies like McKinsey, Bain, and Kearney, we provide top management consulting deliverables and high-quality work to our clients. However, we mainly differentiate ourselves from large management consultancies in our laser-focus and “boutique”-approach. We can credibly state that we have an extensive competence and knowledge base in this specific field (e.g. 50+ projects completed; startup database with 500+ startups from 40+ countries; 600+ expert network for in-depth analysis). All in all, our clients do not need to explain to us their business model and market first before we consult them.” We asked about Bright Green Partner’s future and what they envision for the next five years. “Already today we work with consultants from all over the world – be it Europe, China, India, Australia, the US, or Brazil. For the next year, we strive to hire more consultants for project work to be able to support a larger number of companies. In five years from now, we want to move beyond consulting and to tap into closely related business fields.” And what is your dream scenario? “We envision a world where large companies were able to transform their business to bring profit, planet, and people in a sustainable balance. We think that alternative products have a clear economic advantage towards conventional livestock products – hence, a transformation makes especially sense from a commercial perspective.”               "

10735,New Study Finds Large Demand for Cultured Meat in France and Germany,https://vegconomist.com/studies-and-numbers/new-study-finds-large-demand-for-cultured-meat-in-france-and-germany/,2020-09-28,"A study carried out by the University of Bath, the Université Bourgogne Franche-Comté, and Ipsos has found that increasing numbers of French and German people are open to meatless diets. The study also found that many people in both countries would consider eating cultured meat.  Acceptance of meat-free diets was strongest in Germany, where meat consumption has long been declining. 31 percent of Germans are reducing their meat consumption, and just 45 percent identified as full meat-eaters. This marks the first time that those not limiting meat have been in the minority. 58 percent of Germans said they would be willing to try cultured meat, with most of them willing to buy it themselves. Progress has been slower in France, where there is a strong tradition of meat-eating. However, 26 percent of French people are now following a reduced-meat diet, and 44 percent said they would be willing to try cultured meat. While 69 percent of people still identify as full meat-eaters, nearly half of these are planning to reduce their meat consumption in future. Tradition may not be the only factor though — France has strong agricultural lobbies that have succeeded in banning the use of terms like “sausage” and “milk” to describe vegan products. Cultured meat is on the rise across Europe. Just last week, Dutch company Mosa Meats raised EUR 55M in funding, after reducing its production costs by 88 times. And in the US, the University of California Davis has just received a $3.5M government grant for cultured meat research. “The normality of meat-eaters being the majority is reversing as more people move towards plant-based diets,” lead researcher Chris Bryant told Phys.org. “The development of better and better alternatives, including cultured meat, only makes this transition easier.”    "

Mosa Meat was founded in 2016 by Mark Post and Peter Verstrate, three years after creating the world’s first slaughter-free beefburger through the use of cow cells. It was the result of years of research at the Maastricht University in the Netherlands and cost EUR 250.000 to produce, funded by Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google. Mosa Meat is now scaling up production of this same beef and will use the funds to extend its current pilot production facility at its home in Maastricht, develop an industrial-sized production line, expand its team, and introduce cultivated beef to the consumer market. The Dutch company recently announced it had achieved an 88x reduction in growth costs, as well as the important step of removing Fetal Bovine Serum from the production process. The company states howeever that no launch date is available at present and that will work with regulators to “demonstrate the safety of cultivated beef, in order to achieve regulatory approval to serve consumers in Europe who are craving change.” Blue Horizon Ventures partner Dr. Regina Hecker will join the board of Mosa Meat and will focus on science, scaling and regulatory advancements of the company. “We are excited to be joining Mosa Meat as lead investor in this round” said Dr. Hecker. “Following a thorough investigation of its technology and team, we are convinced that Mosa Meat is strongly placed to pioneer the scale-up of cultured meat.”    "

In this exciting interview we get a sneak preview into some extremely interesting upcoming plans…  Since launching as a small scale operation just four years ago, this much-loved and lauded plant-based producer now offers an enormous range of vegan meats and is beginning to be a household name and serious player, with shares increasing by an incredible 790% on the first week of trading. We were excited to speak with founders and all-round nice guys Mitchell Scott and James Davison about what sets them apart and the plans for the future as they continue their way to vegan stardom. Please introduce your brand for any readers who might not know!
The Very Good Butchers is a plant-based butcher shop and e-commerce store located in Victoria, BC. It started off as a small shop serving its local community and has expanded to provide wholesale, retail and online products across North America. We had very humble beginnings, starting at the farmers market on Denman Island in 2016 and moved into our first location in Victoria in February 2017. It was created out of co-founder James Davison’s desire for a clean label, wholesome alternative to the products that were available on the supermarket shelves.    ©The Very Good Butchers  Where are your products currently available?
We currently sell online via our website across North America. We are also in retail outlets on the West Coast of Canada (BC and Alberta). We’re in around 200 stores including Whole Foods, Thrifty Foods, Choices Markets, Nesters and many others.  Do you have plans to distribute further afield?
Absolutely! We are expanding our retail presence to Central/Eastern Canada later this year and looking at the US for early next year. After that it’s Europe and APAC! We have plans for global expansion of the brand starting with several flagship stores in North America with increased online and retail presence. What are you currently working on? Any new developments or product launches that you can give us a sneak preview into?
We are lucky to have an incredibly talented R&D team working for our brands The Very Good Butchers as well as our parent company The Very Good Food Company. They are working on several very exciting new projects but the one I am most excited for is a competitor to Beyond Meat and Impossible foods using a more wholesome ingredient profile. Our biggest challenge with expanding into a global market is how to use food technology responsibly and keep hold of the whole food values of our founders. Your brand has had an incredible year – please tell us about your IPO launch earlier this summer, can you tell us why you decided to do that and how your company has fared on the open market?
For us, community has always been an important part of our brand and culture. We ran a Kickstarter campaign less than 6 months after opening our butcher shop. We followed that up with an equity crowdfunding campaign on FrontFundr where we raised 600k from 250 investors across Canada. This meant that our company already had a fairly large number of shareholders and becoming a publicly traded company seemed like a logical next step. Along with some encouragement from some avid customers (and investors) we decided to take the plunge and work towards an IPO.  We’re very happy with the results so far. We’re up over 600% and finally have the access to capital we need to expand further and keep butchering beans! Do you think that other plant-based food companies will follow?
Yes, we think we’re going to see more plant-based food companies (both large and small) seriously considering an IPO.  We witnessed a huge rise in plant-based foods during lockdown this year, do you expect that trend to remain stable as people go back to work?
Yes, we think it’s here to stay. There are so many benefits (ethical, environmental, health) and when the products look and taste this good going back to a meat-heavy diet just doesn’t make sense.  How do you see the future of our food supply evolving?
We see meat (being produced traditionally) as becoming increasingly peripheral in our food supply. As governments are waking up to the fact that meat production is incredibly detrimental to our environment, we can see subsidies that were traditionally granted to the meat and dairy industry diverted to more sustainable farming practices, like the production of plant-based proteins and potentially towards cultured meat products.  What are your plans for the rest of this year?
Our big focus for the rest of the year is scaling up production to meet demand. It’s also the holiday season so we are working hard on creating as many Stuffed Beasts as possible. This is our seasonal holiday roast and we’ve already presold thousands of them in retail and online.    "
10759,UC Davis Receives $3.5M Govt Grant as North America Becomes a Pioneer in the Cultured Meat Industry,https://vegconomist.com/science/uc-davis-receives-4-5m-govt-grant-as-north-america-becomes-a-pioneer-in-the-cultured-meat-industry/,2020-09-22,"The National Science Foundation (NSF), an independent federal agency of the US government, has just awarded the University of California Davis with a $3.5 million five-year grant for cultured meat research. With this investment, North America is extending its lead in cultured meat and cultured seafood.  North America, and California in particular, can be described as the pioneering region for cultured meat and seafood research, as three of the current leaders in this sector are based in California, namely Finless Foods, Blue Nalu and Memphis Meat, but also promising newcomers like New Age Meats, all aiming to launch their first cell-based products in the near future. According to a market research report by Technavio, 47% of the global growth in the cultured meat industry between 2020 and 2024 will originate from North America, an area that just received its first major government grant to lay the scientific foundation for the future of cultivated meat production. The new research project of the UC Davis involves an interdisciplinary approach that brings together different disciplines to discover innovation potential for sustainable protein production. The fact that the project is supported by the National Science Foundation, whose official objective is to promote scientific progress and improve national health, reveals a shift in the perception of cultured meat and the opportunities it offers, as reported by Green Queen Media. The official website of the National Science Foundation comments on the goal and relevance of the five-year research project as follows: “The project goal is to establish the scientific and engineering foundation for the nascent cultivated meat industry, address critical scientific and engineering bottlenecks and knowledge gaps that inhibit commercialization, and train the scientists and engineers that will build the industry. Doing so will develop knowledge necessary for the creation of new sustainable protein sources and has the potential to support the growth of a new industry.”    "

Globally in 2019, fermentation companies raised over 3.5 times more capital than cultivated meat companies and close to 60% as much as US plant-based meat, egg, and dairy companies that year.   The Good Food Institute published the first-of-its-kind report today with the aim of highlighting fermentation as a key concept for the realisation of a sustainable food system, and revealing Perfect Day as the current industry leader and most funded alternative protein company in the history of the fermentation industry.  The report demonstrates that globally, fermentation companies in alt protein raised more than $274 million in venture capital funding in 2019 and over 58 percent more in just the first seven months of 2020, $435 million—even as Covid-19 disrupted global markets.   ©Perfect Day Foods  Perfect Day is on a mission to develop a new category of animal-free products and disrupted the dairy industry with the world’s first animal-free dairy ice cream in 2019. Since then, the innovative brand launched its first commercial products in partnership with Smitten Ice Cream and Perfect Day’s spinoff  The Urgent Company. In the next five years, the company aims to have a large portfolio of dairy products using its flora-made protein on the market. The report further analyses the increasing number of fermentation companies worldwide and highlights the growth and innovation potential of the sector. Besides Perfect Day, big players include companies such as MycoTechnology, Motif Food Works and Nature’s Fynd.  A total of $837 million has been invested in fermentation companies since 2013, with 85% of this amount being raised in the last year and a half. As of right now, there are 68 companies operating in the sector worldwide, of which 22 are based in the US and 16 in Europe. GFI Associate Director of Science and Technology, Dr. Liz Specht commented: “Fermentation is powering a new wave of alternative protein products with huge potential for improving flavor, sustainability, and production efficiency. Investors and innovators are recognizing this market potential, leading to a surge of activity in fermentation as an enabling platform for the alternative protein industry as a whole.”    "
10781,Australia: Domestic Plant-Based Industry Identified as an Opportunity for Economic Recovery,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/australia-domestic-plant-based-industry-identified-as-an-opportunity-for-economic-recovery/,2020-09-17,"CSIRO published a report this week identifying opportunities for economic recovery of the Australian industry and discusses the advantages the pandemic has created. According to the report, the domestic plant-based industry could play a major role in the future Australian economy.  In 2019, Food Frontier published a report which said the plant-based industry could generate $3 billion for the Australian economy by 2030, whereas the new report by CSIRO estimates the value of the Australian alternative protein sector at at more than double the value, at $6.6 billion in 2030. Growth opportunities are estimated at $4.1 billion domestic and $2.5 billion export. Commenting on the opportunities for the local industry, CSIRO Futures Lead Economist, Dr Katherine Wynn said in a statement: “The manufacturing sector could maximise its local manufacturing capabilities, creating jobs and adding value to Australia’s growth sectors, particularly in pharmaceuticals, food and beverage manufacturing.“ Australia’s local plant-based industry includes brands such as Fable Foods with its Plant-Based Braised Beef, which was found to be nutritionally superior to animal meat by another Food Frontier report, and Fenn Foods, an Australian plant meat producer that aims to have all of its products carbon-neutral by 2022. The third pillar of the Australian plant-based industry is formed by the startup V2Food, which emerged from a partnership between CSIRO and Main Sequence Ventures in 2019. Last month, the startup launched its plant-based mince and burger products into Australia’s supermarket chain Drakes and further plans to become the number one brand for plant-based products in Australia. V2Food also announced this week to appoint Professor Martin Cole, ex-Deputy Director of CSIRO Agriculture & Food, to become its new Chief Scientific Advisor. Following an article by Which-50, Cole has been the leader of several projects in the field of food safety, novel processing and nutritional food security over the last decade. Professor Cole told Which-50 that Australia faces a real chance to become a global leader for plant-based protein, saying that: “As a nation, we are globally competitive on grain and meat exports. However, we can be delivering far greater value out of the raw commodities we produce. That’s where v2food comes in. Grounded in CSIRO science and with the expertise of Nick Hazell at the helm, v2 wants to take Australian plant-based meat to the world and this means adding even more value to Australian agriculture. I am excited to join this first-class team and to be able to bring the transdisciplinary expertise from across the University of Adelaide, CSIRO and our partners together.”    "
10812,Australian Startup Vow Creates ‘Unusual Species’ Meat Including Kangaroo & Alpaca,https://vegconomist.com/startups/australian-startup-vow-creates-unusual-species-meat-including-kangaroo-alpaca/,2020-09-10,"Vow, a Sydney-based innovative food startup developing unconventional meat products directly from animal cells, just announced the world-first culinary demonstration of its multi-species meat platform with top Australian chefs Neil Perry and Corey Costelloe on board.  According to the company, only four animal species supply the majority of globally available meat products, which represents 0.02% of total options. In fact, 99.8% of species are still comparatively undiscovered for an application in the global food industry. Founded in April 2019 in Australia, Vow plans to focus not only on more unusual species but also on a more ethical production without animal suffering. Vow’s vision is to create new meat options that are intended to be healthier than conventional meat products, which is a realistic claim in the light of a recent report which found meat substitutes to be nutritionally superior to animal products. In terms of the cultured meat company’s concept, Vow does not directly compete with the plant-based industry, which has so far concentrated on beef, fish, chicken and pork alternatives. Other cultured meat startups, such as Mosa Meats, which recently reduced its production costs by a factor of 88, or Mission Barns, also create meat products within these four species categories. For the product demonstration, Australia’s most famous chefs Neil Perry, who is also an expert in Asian cuisine, and Corey Costelloe, joined forces to design and create six dishes from different animal species, including dishes like kangaroo crystal dumplings or alpaca chili tarama. In this context, the company’s current focus is on building an optimized meat prototype and to develop new products aimed at markets in the Asia-Pacific region. “Until now the cultured meat industry has been focused on better ways of making the meat we most commonly eat today,” said George Peppou, Co-founder & CEO of Vow. “This milestone demonstrates we can grow the cells of any animal, not just those we can farm, marking a turning point for the cultured meat industry and our food system as a whole. To make food without compromise we must stop looking backward to how our ancestors produced and ate food and instead choose how we will eat in the future.”    "
10813,New Age Meats: “There’s a Reason We’re Called New Age Meats. The Definition of Meat is Changing.”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/new-age-meats-theres-a-reason-were-called-new-age-meats-the-definition-of-meat-is-changing/,2020-09-09,"   We understand that your product development is focused on “interrogating the science of meat”, to understand why it tastes and feels the way it does, can you tell us more about that?
How do cells make the sensory characteristics that we care about? To understand that, we start with the human perception of meat. This allows us to see the biomarkers that we can then have the cells make more efficiently.  Why is cellbased meat important right now and how much potential to disrupt animal agriculture do you believe it offers as a segment?
We’re pretty open that we make blended products of cultivated and plant based meat, but the real question is that of demand and our planet’s ability to supply the food required to feed ourselves. The UNFAO predicts that we will need to grow our food supply by 70% by 2050, a growth rate which outpaces our land and resource availability. We’re not seeking disruption so much as augmentation to meet that increased demand.  What do you envisage the protein market will look like in the future?
There’s a reason we’re called New Age Meats. The definition of meat is changing. We’re not limited to meat coming from the carcass of an animal. That’s like a horse and buggy. We’re a car. We have complete control over our process, which allows us to craft meat better than anything we currently consume.  We covered a report from the GAO back in May that stated that cell-based meat is stuck in the Research and Development stage, what are your thoughts on this?
The GAO performs invaluable services, but innovation is not one of them. Thinking that the pathway forward is to convert existing technologies in industries like biopharma and cellular therapeutics leads one to believe that the industry has a long way to go. Creating new pathways through whitespace is what startups do.  New Age Meats has secured $5M in funding to date; investors seem keen to be a part of this fledgling industry despite concerns noted from the GAO, will you be announcing further funding rounds? Absolutely. Alternative proteins comprise less than half a percent of the massive worldwide meat market. We’ll never make a dent in that market if we grow slowly. We make the future of meat, and investors are eager to join us in that journey.  Can we expect to see your ‘pork’ sausage in the market in the near future? What challenges do you face with this?
Yes! We’re continually dropping the cost and ramping up production. Here in the US, regulators are moving quickly to allow us to come to market, and that’s mirrored by other countries, notably in Asia.  Where do you see New Age Meats in the next five years?
Pork products are where we start. In the next five years, we’ll have multiple types of meat products in different geographies and distribution channels.    "

Mushlabs previously raised $2.2 million, bringing its total raised to date to $12.2M.  Mushlabs was founded in 2018 by CEO Mazen Rizk, and since then the company has been part of the Proveg Incubator, an international food awareness organisation working to transform the global food system by replacing conventional animal-based products. In an introductory Medium article, the Berlin-based team describes itself: “Mushlabs is a biotechnology company that is creating sustainable and delicious foods from mycelium (the roots of mushrooms). We believe in the power of biotechnology in disrupting the food industry and we want to bring about a meaningful and lasting change to our food system through our fermentation technology.” On the importance of the use of fungi as a foodstuff, which as we reported this February was found in a scientific paper to be a highly sustainable and nutritious option for meat alternatives, Mushlabs explains that, “Products made from soy or pea proteins increase the demand for land to grow these crops, the same grown to feed cattle. At Mushlabs, we look elsewhere for our food product — to mycelium: the underground web that sends up mushrooms. Instead of needing soil, fungal mycelium can be cultivated in large vertical bioreactors.”    "

We spoke to Rich Kelleman, founder and CEO, to find out more.  Firstly please introduce your brand to any readers who may not know you.
I’m a former advertising executive, and Bond was born after I worked on the Burger King account. The experience opened my eyes to the challenges attached to conventional agriculture, including meat production, turning me into a vegan. Years later, when my wife and I got our first dog together, we wrestled with the tension of feeding our dog (and cats) meat, and asked — could there be a better way? Tell us about your new animal-free chicken protein prototype? How is it made?
Using a proprietary production process that is more humane and sustainable compared with conventional agriculture, Bond is able to take a harmless, one-time blood sample — in this case, from a heritage hen named Inga who is alive and well at a farm in Lindsborg, Kansas — to determine the genetic code for the best types of chicken proteins to nourish dogs and cats. The genetic code is then coupled with a strain of food-grade yeast. When this yeast is grown in a fermentation tank, it churns out meat proteins that are identical to those typically produced on farm and field. It’s a similar fermentation process that’s been used for half a century to make enzymes for cheese, but Bond is reassembling the process to harvest high-quality animal proteins. When do you expect to launch the product?
Our first chicken-based products will debut in 2023. Do you foresee other applications for your fermentation technology?
We’ll be making other cultured meat proteins in the years ahead for pet nutrition, like turkey, pork, and beef. Other applications including the human food space are also being explored. What differentiates you from other brands producing animal-free pet food?
We’re honored to be part of a growing number of companies that are looking to provide alternatives when it comes to the food we feed our pets. To start, we’re all working with similar, high-quality plant-based and microbial proteins that are readily available. The biggest difference comes in our future tech — the platforms that each company is working with to produce meat proteins for pet food. We’re currently the only company developing meat proteins through microbial fermentation in the pet food space. Are you working on developing any other products?
While our cultured proteins are in development, we launched our first product last May — a protein-packed dog treat bar made with pure nutritional yeast. While not animal-derived, the yeast protein in the recipe is made through a similar fermentation technique, allowing us to begin educating the public about the beauty of proteins and products made through microbial fermentation. What is your mission as a company, and how do you hope to achieve it?
Our mission at Bond Pet Foods is to be an ally for all animals through a commitment to finding a better way to make complete, nutritious food for our pets. Bond is a Boulder, Colorado-based pet food company using biotechnology to create food that’s nutritionally comparable to conventional meat but without all the bad stuff; so people, pets, farm animals, and the planet all win. Using some of the same processes that are employed in craft brewing, Bond produces high-quality cultured fungal and animal proteins through fermentation, harvests them to better meet the nutritional requirements of companion animals, and uses the ingredients as the foundation of its complete recipes. What are your plans for the rest of 2020?
We recently closed additional capital. With those resources, we will be accelerating the development of our proprietary proteins, as well as expanding our reach for our first-gen dog treat bars.    "

At present, OmniPork’s promising coverage continues as the company recently announced to launch OmniPork and OmniEat in 210 stores across all China.  Often, plant-based products are launched primarily in large cities because consumers there are said to be more willing to accept new products. However, a consumer acceptance rate of 62.4% in Asia for alternative proteins indicates much more potential. Coupled with the current inflation of pork prices, all factors are directed towards a China-wide demand for OmniPork products. In response, OmniPork and OmniEat will launch in 210 stores across all China, including Olé, 7Fresh, Parkson and Metro, as well as city’super, Sogo, Apita and Cityshop in Shanghai. In addition, fast food chain JiXiang Wonton will launch OmniPork Wonton in all locations in China soon.    "
10879,New Zealand & Australia – New Report Finds Plant Meats “Nutritionally Superior” to Animal Products,https://vegconomist.com/studies-and-numbers/new-zealand-australia-new-report-finds-plant-meats-nutritionally-superior-to-animal-products/,2020-08-25,"Food Frontier, an independent think tank on alternative proteins in Australia and New Zealand, has released a first-of-its-kind report that analyses the health and nutrition of plant-based meat products available in said countries, citing Sunfed Meats and Fable Foods as the biggest plant meat brands in the region.  This report is particularly relevant as health concerns are the main factor in the transition to a plant-based diet. Earlier this year, New Zealand published “The Green Report”, which demonstrates compelling evidence for a need for New Zealand to change how it farms and produces food, concluding that the transition from animal to plant agriculture is extremely important in terms of sustainability and food safety. For consumers, however, health is the main driver to eat less meat, and with the local plant-based meat category in New Zealand growing rapidly, more consumers are naturally asking whether these alternatives make for a healthier switch. The report compares the nutritional averages of plant-based meat categories to similarly processed, conventional meats, and further explores other health impacts of plant-based meats. Key findings reveal that: In addition, the report highlights products that offer superior nutrition and clean labels. Among the two top performers is Sunfed with its Chicken Free Chicken, which was a sell-out success in New Zealand supermarkets, and Australia’s Fable Foods with its hugely popular product Plant-Based Braised Beef. Speaking about the research results which are communicated in the new report, co-author and Accredited Practising Dietitian Teri Lichtenstein said: This report shows plant-based meats on average are nutritionally superior or comparable and offer some of the benefits of plant-based eating, even though they are processed foods just like their conventional meat equivalents. They also do not present the potential health risks that some conventional meats pose, from foodborne illness to links to non-communicable disease.”    "
10882,"Top Tier Foods: “Chef Toju Thought He Was Eating Real Wagyu Beef, not Something Made of Plants”",https://vegconomist.com/interviews/top-tier-foods-chef-toju-thought-he-was-eating-real-wagyu-beef-not-something-made-of-plants/,2020-08-25,"Based in Canada, Top Tier Foods produces a vegan Wagyu beef called Waygu – a product so authentic that a renowned master chef reportedly could not tell the difference between the two. We spoke with founder Blair Bullus on what sets this vegan beef apart and makes it “not just another plant-based ground beef company.  We asked Blair about his motivation behind starting Top Tier Foods. The young businessman said that his aim was “to create a company that could innovate and create the best tasting, most ethically-produced products in the world by using the latest in food science. He explains that, “Top Tier Foods was established as a reaction to mass-produced, low-quality ready-made meals that used unnerving levels of refined sugars, salt, artificial flavours and colours to mask foods that are low in nutrition.” What is your current vegan product portfolio? And what is your best seller?
We started out creating quinoa-based products including Sushi Quinoa, the world’s first sticky quinoa for sushi, before making the move into meat alternatives. Although we were 100% plant-based from the start, our transition into animal protein alternatives was gradual and due in large part to the demand brought forward from the environmental crisis we face. When we created Sushi Quinoa it quickly became our best seller. Through Sushi Quinoa’s development process I forged an unlikely friendship with a master sushi Chef, Hidekazu Tojo. Chef Tojo was kind enough to provide feedback to me, a young 27-year-old entrepreneur at the time, on my research and development of Sushi Quinoa. This guidance from Chef Tojo helped Top Tier Foods create our world-leading products that are fit for a Japanese master chef. His support over the years has been immeasurable and contributed greatly to our plant-based Waygu. He described our final version as “amazing” and said “I am very impressed” after initially unknowingly believing he was eating actual wagyu beef, not our plant-based version. What differentiates Top Tier Foods products from other vegan food suppliers, how do you stand out against any competitors?
We are very different and not just another plant-based ground beef company. At Top Tier Foods we have consistently developed unique, leading edge products that are backed by top chefs and largest restaurant groups. It is our commitment to creativity that allows us to deliver interesting food products that are compelling to the consumer, such as Sushi Quinoa. But maybe most importantly is our commitment to taste. When we set forth developing our plant-based Waygu we wanted to create the world’s best tasting plant-based beef alternative. Chef Tojo’s reaction to the sample we gave him is testament to that – when thought he was eating real wagyu beef and not something made of plants. Waygu is particularly interesting – since Wagyu is so prestigious, please tell us how you think your version compares to its animal counterpart and why you chose to veganise this particular meat.
We wanted to make sure we got our plant-based Waygu right. Wagyu beef is widely considered the best beef in the world by meat eaters and is renowned for its fat marbling and tender qualities.  To make sure we replicated wagyu as closely as possible, we partnered with Japanese manufacturers who both understand wagyu beef better than anyone (wagyu literally means: “wa” – Japanese, “gyu” – cattle) and have centuries of working with soybeans, the main ingredients in Waygu. Japanese people have used soybeans in food productions dating back over 1000 years using it in textured products like tofu and bean curd, as well as fermented items such as miso and soy sauce. We were able to leverage many of these traditional methods including fermentation to create a product that is uniquely Japanese and extremely similar to its animal counterpart. How is your vegan Wagyu produced – what are the ingredients and are they sustainable?
Waygu is produced using many of these traditional Japanese methods and ingredients, including use of a gluten-free soy sauce made just 45 minutes away from the product facility. By leveraging traditional cooking methods, we have been able to create a product that is very sustainable and clean label in comparison to other similar products on the market. Our ingredients list includes typically Japanese ingredients such as rice wine, seasoned ginger, garlic and soy sauce. JAT Oppenheimer has released a vegan Wagyu in Australia amidst a backlash overuse of the original name, what is your opinion on the farmers’ response? 
We don’t expect any controversy over Waygu as we are competing for two uniquely different clientele, that is vegetarians and vegans. With our plant-based Waygu we look to celebrate the work of wagyu cattle farmers by creating a product of equal stature that can be enjoyed by people who for individual reasons have chosen not to eat meat. You have glittering endorsements from Master Chef Toju. Please tell us about his involvement with your company?
Chef Tojo is one of the most respected sushi chefs in the world. Involved in the creation of the California roll and recognized by the Japanese Government as a Cultural Ambassador. Chef Tojo’s restaurant, Tojo’s, is consistently ranked inside the top 100 restaurants in Canada and is a must place to visit for A-list celebrities when they are in town, even serving the British Royal Family. About 6 years ago, I reached out to chef Tojo to see if he would be interested in testing out a new product that we had developed at Top Tier Foods called Sushi Quinoa, a sticky quinoa for sushi. He was the only chef to reply out of about a dozen we called, but his reputation preceded him so I was excited and nervous to meet the master Chef. Chef Tojo it turned out could not have been nicer. His enthusiasm and curiosity for food was infectious and mirrored my own creative spirit. He was immediately interested in our Sushi Quinoa and helped greatly in the development process. Chef Tojo and I quickly became friends during that time working on Sushi Quinoa and continue to remain close to this day helping each other with many projects and events over the years. Through this friendship Chef Tojo was able to help Top Tier Foods develop a reputation for creating world class sushi products more-or-less in exchange for first access to whatever we created next. Tojo has no official role in Top Tier Foods but his feedback and friendship has been key to our continued success. Where are your products available and do you have plans to expand into other markets?
All of our products (including Sushi Quinoa and Waygu) will be available for restaurants across North America now and into Europe and Asia shortly. We have been lucky enough to partner with one of the biggest Japanese food distributors in the world, Wismettac Asian Foods who will begin distributing Waygu later this month in North America. We are getting strong interest from Asia and Europe so will be working quickly to move into those markets as well. Do you have any more exciting new vegan products in development?
We always have a pretty good pipeline of products in development, so make sure to follow along on our social media to see what we have coming up next. In your opinion, why should the food industry continue to acknowledge veganism?
Of course, as a company Top Tier Foods will continue to advocate for a reduction in the overall consumption of animal proteins due to their continued adverse impact on the environment. As time goes on and populations continue to grow, we must also continue to look for alternative protein sources or face food insecurity as the infrastructure around animal farming cannot keep up with the rising demands. What are you aiming for as a company or what is your mission, and how do you hope to achieve it?
We want to continue to put all our attention into creating the world’s best tasting products. We know that if we can do so with a commitment to sustainable ingredients and practices, good things will happen. It is as simple as that.  Where do you see Top Tier Foods in the next five years?

10889,World Plant Milk Day Finale: Introducing The Global Plant Milk Brand Landscape,https://vegconomist.com/fairs-and-events/world-plant-milk-day-finale-introducing-the-global-plant-milk-brand-landscape/,2020-08-22,"We are coming to the end of our World Plant Milk Day series, which featured quality plant milk brands from around the world. There are so many incredible companies in this sector that we couldn’t possibly feature them all, but we salute their innovation and dedication. Whilst there is still animal milk on the market, there is room for more plant-based milk!  The plant-based sector is exploding and plant milk is now the leading segment in this sector, fuelled by consumer demand. We have shown this week that plant milk companies are passionate about meeting this demand and that they are providing innovative and delicious products with the potential to replace animal milk altogether. The companies we have featured are focused on nutrition, taste, minimising environmental impact, and being cruelty-free; they demonstrate that animal milk has surely had its day. We couldn’t feature them all, but KindEarth.Tech cofounder Olivia Fox Cabane has certainly tried to in her Global Plant Milk Brand Landscape. The landscape is now online thanks to Kristopher Gasteratos, Founder and President of CAS (the Cellular Agriculture Society). This is an epic piece of work that was made possible by a team of volunteers, who strived to get this landscape ready so we could launch it as the grand finale to our week of celebrating plant milks. Thank you to everyone who helped make this a reality. Though this live map shows only milk, there are static maps for Alternative Protein, Dairy, Cheese, Algae and Fungi available at newprotein.org. If your brand is not on a landscape and should be, you can register here.    "
10892,Lever VC Launches New $23M Fund Targeting Global Alternative Protein Sector,https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/lever-vc-launches-new-23m-fund-targeting-global-alternative-protein-sector/,2020-08-21,"Global alt-protein venture capital fund Lever VC has closed its first fund with $23 million in capital commitments. The fund was formed by partners who have successfully invested in Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, Memphis Meats, and other sector leaders.  Alternative protein, which generally refers to plant-based and food-tech alternatives to animal protein, has been one of the most popular investment trends in recent years. Barclays, UBS, and JP Morgan predict that the sector will grow by 31% year over year, becoming an $85-$140 billion market over the next ten to fifteen years.  Lever VC, which is investing in early-stage plant-based and cell-cultivated meat and dairy companies, has already amassed a portfolio of ten alternative protein startups in Hong Kong, mainland China, Singapore, and the rest of the world. It has attracted strong support, with around 70% of its capital commitments coming from Hong Kong and Asian investors. The Lever VC Fund I portfolio includes Singapore-based Turtle Tree Labs, the first company to develop cow’s milk and human breast milk from cell cultivation, Hong Kong-based Avant, the leading cell-cultivated meat company in the greater China region, and Bond Pet Foods, the first company in the world producing real meat protein from fermentation. Speaking about the global alternative protein sector and its potential for investors, Lever VC partner Lawrence Chu said: “The alternative protein market is continuing to grow quickly, and with our deep experience and proven record of returns in the sector, as well as the preeminent deal flow across Asia, North America, Europe and beyond, Lever VC is perfectly positioned to deliver value to investors looking for financial or strategic exposure to alternative protein and the broader impact investing market.”    "
10913,"Drivers, milestones and challenges in plant-based fish development – and the innovators making waves",https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/drivers-milestones-and-challenges-in-plant-based-fish-development-and-the-innovators-making-waves/,2020-08-18,"Over the past few years, in line with demand, plant-based meat alternatives have moved from restaurant experimentations to mainstream brands large and small, with meat such as chicken, beef, and pork now being regularly mimicked across retail and foodservice.  This article was originally published in The Cream on 29th July and is being reproduced with kind courtesy. The likes of THIS, Impossible Foods and Daring Foods – not to mention a plethora of major retailer own-brands – are blazing a trail in the vegan protein space, with more emerging every month. Global interest is booming, with recent research from the FAIRR Investor Network revealing that over £850m of venture investment has flowed into alternative proteins in the first half of 2020 – more than double last year’s total investment of £412m. There can be no doubt that plant-based products will continue to evolve over the coming years, and the advancement of fish alternatives looking certain to be a new frontier for the category, with consumer focus on sustainability, food waste and health driving factors in its emergence. Three key drivers According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, a third of global fisheries are overfished and an additional two thirds are fished at maximum capacity. Issues with sustainability have a real impact on consumer perceptions of food products, with a recent survey from Getty Images revealing 84% of UK consumers say that being environmentally friendly is important to them. There have been moves from UK retailers to get consumers to try alternatives to the most popular fish choices, including Iceland’s What The Fish? – a bag of ‘bycatch’ white fish containing the likes of megrim, pouting, grey gurnard and whiting. However, the classic favourites remain. Salmon dominates the UK chilled fish market (commanding 38.1% of the market share in 2019, according to Kantar), followed by usual suspects prawn, cod and haddock. Food waste is also high on the agenda for consumers. Fillets are the end goal for most kitchens and retailers, with the remainder of the fish often either thrown away or used to make stock. It’s no surprise that salmon farming continues to be a controversial subject in terms of ethics and sustainability, with figures released this week by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency revealing that the amount of salmon killed by diseases and other problems at fish farms has reached record levels, with death rates quadrupling over the last 18 years. According to the Sustainable Restaurant Association, only 43% of the 900,000 tonnes of the fish and shellfish landed in the UK every year ends up on the plate, with chefs such as Josh Niland in Sydney now pioneering ways to use the whole of each fish as part of the new ‘fish butchery’ concept. In terms of health, shellfish allergies are common, and the ability to create safe options for consumers a potential driver of sales in a previously-untapped market, in the same way dairy allergies were part of the trigger for development of plant-based milk alternatives. Considering the importance of environmental emphasis in food production and the added health perceptions when pitching to consumers, the potential of plant-based fish and seafood alternatives is clear. However, to date it’s been a tough market to crack, with Mike Hibberd, Morrisons’ head chef of manufacturing, telling The Cream that he is yet to find real advances in the texture of plant-based fish alternatives.

10923,Restaurant Recession or Revival? Vegan Eateries Set To Thrive,https://vegconomist.com/gastronomy-and-catering/restaurant-recession-or-revival-vegan-eateries-set-to-thrive/,2020-08-14,"“In 2018, when my partner’s (not exclusively vegan) restaurant was at the peak of its success, I convinced him to get out of the industry forever. The way people eat is changing, I argued. He agreed.” Says Veronica Fil.  “So much that we left the restaurant industry to become plant-based cheese entrepreneurs—much to the confusion of almost everyone we knew. It didn’t make sense because at the time, Australia’s fine dining scene was having a moment—and we were part of that boom. It felt like even the most trivial restaurant industry news would make national headlines (who’s opening? Who’s closing? Who’s about to launch a new menu featuring native foraged sea-greens?). High profile chefs were getting treated like rock stars, flexing their tatts and headlining festivals in exchange for luxury car sponsorships. And for the small number of restaurants that offered dedicated vegan menus—ourselves included—business had never been better. Behind the scenes, however, the reality was far less glamorous. Australia’s hospitality industry was poisoned by wage scandals. By precariously thin operational margins, negative workplace cultures and questionable HR practices. By the constant threat of predatory players like UberEats, who were gouging independent restaurants with obscene commissions and questionable policies, and the ongoing shift towards casual dining options (continually creeping towards lower cost, quick service solutions). Chefs and independent operators were busting their butts to get by, working insane hours just to keep their businesses afloat. The industry was completely unsustainable, and we decided that it was time to get out. Fast forward to 2020, and I’m grateful for our timing. Because, while I sensed a crash was looming, I certainly never expected to see the entire industry collapse overnight due to Covid. Not just in Australia either, but all over the world where dining rooms have been ordered to shut—and restaurants try to navigate a new environment of uncertainty, confusing regulatory guidelines, and economic hardship. So what’s this got to do with veganism? Well, it’s all happened at a pretty interesting time in history. Even before Covid, the move towards plant-based eating was happening at monumental force–and there were more vegan restaurants popping up each week than ever. Even traditional restaurants had stopped fighting the ‘trend’ and were beginning to provide decent plant-based options on their menus. Unfortunately, very few of these businesses were built to withstand a global pandemic. Those that aren’t equipped for takeaway or delivery have closed; a large number will never reopen. And that feels like a huge setback to the progress of vegan dining. Or so you’d think. See, I’m one of those irritating people who seem hardwired to find the opportunity in even the most dreadful situations. And while I’m saddened to watch the impact that Covid has had on the traditional hospitality industry, this is the chance for vegan businesses to take the reins and help us rebuild this industry for the better. Opening a Vegan Restaurant During Covid According to Happy Cow, there have been 88 vegan restaurant closures in the US since March. But in the same period, there’s been 99 new ones added to their online database. On face value, those stats appear pretty crazy. But let’s break that down. From a purely economic perspective, here’s why bullish business owners might be seizing the opportunity to open a vegan venture during a global pandemic. Home cooking fatigue. Just because restaurants are becoming extinct, doesn’t mean that people don’t want to eat in them. As social distancing restrictions ease, I expect restaurants to become overwhelmed with diners who are just relieved to be outside again (and are desperate for a meal that’s not homemade sourdough). There will always be a demand for restaurants. Reduced set up costs. Right now, the market is flooded with second-hand equipment from businesses that have been unable to survive the turbulence. The mass exodus has also caused rents to drop, and lease terms become more favorable. A boost to the talent pool. Finding and retaining high-quality hospitality staff was previously one of the most difficult aspects of restaurant-running. But as unemployment levels rise, there’s a legion of experienced hospitality professionals who are available, and desperate, for work.   Record low-interest rates. Near 0% in the US and 0.25% in Australia (as of July 2020). The aim of this monetary policy maneuver is to drive lending (and spending) at a time when economic activity needs a boost. Expect to see additional government incentives and small business initiatives announced in the coming months. Lower competition. Even multi-location restaurant empires are crumbling at the moment, which makes it much easier for small businesses to wedge themselves into the market—with less threat of behemoth competition. Consumer-driven demand for alternative proteins. As covid fears continue, people are rethinking their relationship with animals and food…and decided that this meat-eating thing isn’t worth messing with. Any restaurant that can offer a tasty, healthier and more sustainable alternative is going to win their business. While these points shape a decent business case, I don’t think they’re enough to convince me to open up a dining room any time soon. They do, however, suggest some very favorable conditions for restaurant businesses that can cater to the new dining landscape. It makes total sense, for instance, to see new delivery-only or takeaway vegan restaurants pop onto the scene. Recent data collected by online delivery platforms backup that thought. Last month, DoorDash reported a huge increase in the number of vegan burgers that people had ordered during the first six months of 2020. That’s good news for eateries that are set up for casual dining, but not so great for the struggling Michelin Star venues…many of which are being replaced by dark kitchens. Whether or not this is a bad thing depends on which side of the equation you are, I guess. ********** For any existing restaurant owner, the impacts of the pandemic must be devastating. But economically, I’d argue that the model was doomed from the start—and long overdue for a rethink. Covid has forced us to do that. I hope that it leads to fresh perspectives, greater diversity, and more opportunities for plant-based businesses to get a foot in the door. The new dining landscape, as it regrows, looks lusciously green.”    "

Serendipitously, we here report extremely encouraging news from OmniFoods.  Pork is a staple food in China and is consumed daily by 60% of the population, giving it the greatest influence on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). In 2019, Pork had a share of 30% of the country’s record inflation of 2,9%. Last month, pork prices increased by 85.7% year-on-year, expanding 10.3% from June alone, as confirmed by new data from the National Bureau of Statistics. Meanwhile, OmniFoods shows no signs of slowing down its reign of success with the rollout of Omnipork products around Hong Kong, mainland China, and the rest of Asia. It is revealed that fast food chain JiXiang Wonton, a household name across the country, has added vegan Omnipork dumplings to menus across 500 locations in Shanghai. According to the JiXiang press release, after launching OmniPork wonton in their 500 locations in Shanghai they will be launching in all locations in China soon. “JiXiang chose Shanghai to first launch the OmniPork wonton because the consumers in Shanghai are more willing to accept new products. Soon after launching in Shanghai, it has become a hot product, the response is very positive. In the first week, some branches were sold out of the OmniPork wonton.” At the present time, it seems more pertinent than ever to focus on the emergence of plant-based industry in China, and encouragingly the number of vegetarians has exceeded 50 million and is growing rapidly. As we reported,  consumer acceptance is at 62.4% in Asia for alternative proteins. We will continue to report on Asia and especially China as an important part of the change in the world which we all hope for and are working towards.    "

According to a press release, the company ended up selling over a month’s worth of sandwiches in less than a day. Now it has decided to make the chicken-less chicken sandwich a permanent addition to its menu.  The company appears to be well-aware of the concerns of many vegans, some of whom have gone as far as filing lawsuits against fast-food chains for cooking plant-based foods alongside their meaty counterparts. Therefore, KFC has taken the decision to cook its vegan sandwich on a separate fryer, which it also uses for its French fries. The sandwich will be available at all Kentucky Fried Chicken locations across Canada as of August 10th. At the end of last month, KFC scheduled a trial of Beyond Fried Chicken in 50+ locations in Southern California, including  LA, Orange County, and San Diego areas, for a limited time. Outside of North America, the world-famous fast-food chain has had significant success with its plant-based options. In January it announced its vegan burger would be available permanently in UK locations. Earlier this year, it was announced that Yum China’s KFC would sell plant-based fried chicken, produced by Cargill Ltd, for a trial period, and KFC Russia is collaborating with 3D Bioprinting Solutions, a Russian research laboratory, to create the world’s first 3D printed chicken nuggets, which are scheduled for trial towards the end of this year. Kentucky Fried Chicken, which was founded in 1939 and is a subsidiary of Yum!Brands, can be found in 120 countries and is listed at #2 among the top ten global fast-food brands, according to Forbes.  Bruce Friedrich, executive director of The Good Food Institute, contacted us last month and praised KFC for its recent plant-based additions and innovations, saying this “could mark one of the most significant moments of 2020 for alternative proteins.”    "
10967,"Nature’s Fynd: “This is the Moonshot of Our Time. The Stakes are Higher Than Ever, But Solutions Like Ours Offer Greater Potential”",https://vegconomist.com/interviews/natures-fynd-this-is-the-moonshot-of-our-time-the-stakes-are-higher-than-ever-but-solutions-like-ours-offer-greater-potential/,2020-08-04,"Nature’s Fynd is a sustainable foods company employing breakthrough fermentation technology to produce Fy™, the product of a cultivated, naturally occurring microorganism from the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park, which is being used to produce great tasting, earth-friendly foods.  Nature’s Fynd recently secured $80 Million in series A funding for development of this protein which comes from volcanic sources in one of the most exciting developments in food we have ever reported on. We were fascinated to speak with Chief Marketing Officer Karuna Rawal about this “new to the world” alt protein for a future of sustainability derived from innovative fermentation processes. Please introduce Nature’s Fynd to our readers and explain briefly what you do.
Nature’s Fynd is a Chicago-based food tech company creating versatile alternative proteins to feed the world’s growing population while nurturing the planet. Starting with a microscopic organism, Nature’s Fynd is introducing an entirely new protein source in the global food supply chain. Born out of research conducted for NASA on microbes in Yellowstone National Park, the company’s technology produces a complete protein using only a fraction of the resources required by traditional agriculture. Using this new to the world protein source called Fy™, Nature’s Fynd creates a wide range of truly delicious foods—all free from animal products—that nourish your body and nurture our planet for future generations. You are using fermentation technology – how does that benefit the process?
We discovered a microorganism originating in the geothermal hot springs of Yellowstone National Park. This microorganism is 100% natural and efficient, made up largely of protein and part of the fungi kingdom, just like yeast. A small sample of this microorganism was taken initially from Yellowstone without causing harm to the park or its hot springs. This small sample is used to grow Fy™, our nutritional fungi protein, outside of Yellowstone using a fermentation process similar to brewing beer or making soy sauce — and we’ll never have to return to harvest more. This process allows us to create delicious, highly nutritious food with incredible efficiency, while minimizing the usage of water, land, and other agricultural inputs. Our “growing season” never stops—we can produce 365 days per year, independent of traditional seasonal cycles. Not only that, our organism’s rate of reproduction far outpaces that of traditional agricultural products; we can produce a high volume of nutrient-rich food in a fraction of the time. Fermentation has given us beer, wine, cheese, and bread—staple ingredients for a life well-lived. Now, fermentation has unlocked the future of how we eat. Thanks to our unique fermentation process, we could produce Fy™ in Montana, or Chicago, or on the moon, 365 days a year, and create nutritious food.  Nature’s Fynd has recently secured $80 Million in funding, please tell us how this finance will be used.
With our Series A round of funding, we have successfully proven our technology and established operational, commercial, and managerial foundations that we are proud and excited to have. With our Series B funds, we will be scaling our technology and operations in order to commercialize our high-quality, nutritious products with minimal environmental impact to be true to our mission of nourishing people and nurturing the planet. Your company is spearheading some incredible innovations, how do you see this impacting our food supply?
Our food landscape—what we eat, where it’s made, and the choices we have—stands to be radically altered in the coming decades. Climate change and the challenges facing the food supply system isn’t a problem facing one company or one industry. It’s a cultural challenge, with solutions requiring innovation and inspiration. We believe, time and again, our planet has provided us with what we need to thrive as a species. Today, as we face unprecedented environmental challenges, nature has offered us an unprecedented opportunity to nourish our population: a naturally delicious, nutritious, and sustainable food product. The challenges we face in our food system won’t be fixed by a miracle. The solution lies in the elegance and efficiency of nature. Now more than ever, we need to be able to do more using less resources to feed our growing population. This is the moonshot of our time. Providing a system to feed the world in a way that’s good for human health and the health of the planet is an audacious goal, but it’s one Nature’s Fynd is prepared to meet. The stakes are higher than ever, but solutions like ours offer greater potential.  By introducing an entirely new, highly efficient protein source in the global food supply chain, we are optimistic about the impact that we can have on the global food system. Finding the microbes in a volcano is quite extraordinary, what other possibilities do you think are out there?
At our core, we are a company built on discovery and optimism.  We believe that scientific curiosity and human ingenuity can unlock nature’s own solutions to humanity’s biggest challenges.  So as a company based in science, our scientists continue to work on a range of interesting projects including working with NASA.  And we are always excited about the possibilities that scientific thinking can unlock. Are you still looking for other extraordinary sources of protein?
At this time, we are focused on bringing Fy to market but of course our research team continues to be on the cutting edge of new sustainable sources of protein. Does your protein carry any of its own features, like for example taste and texture?
The protein ingredient that we make from this simple process, Fy™, is a complete protein with all 9 essential amino acids, which help build muscle. This nutritional fungi protein is also highly digestible and our bodies can absorb the nutritious protein content easier than peas, peanuts and many other plant-based proteins. Plus, it has calcium, fiber, and no cholesterol or trans fats. Our protein is very versatile and can be made into delicious foods and drinks. It can be made into alternative meats (like burgers & chicken), alternative dairy foods (yogurt, cheese, etc.), and drinks (like ready-to-drink-protein shakes) because it can take on different textures and tastes, depending on how it’s cooked, flavored or seasoned. When do you think that your protein will be available to use? How will your protein get to our dinner table? For example, are you looking for partnerships with food producers?
We are a food brand that makes final food products. With our extraordinary nutritional fungi protein called Fy, we will be making a variety of foods that you know and love—and you will be able to find them directly on your grocery store shelves. Our protein’s versatility enables us to make a wide range of products and we will of course consider whether we would make each and every one of these or enter into partnerships with other food companies. What are your plans for the rest of the year?
We’ve made and tested a wide range of delicious foods—we are now being smart about which ones come first. What we can say is to keep an eye out for both meat and dairy alternative foods! We expect to have a smaller scale test in market in the next 12-15 months as we are in discussions with retailers now.    "

In just the first seven months of the year, $1.1 billion was invested in plant-based meat alternatives compared to $457 million last year. Investment in cultured meat has been almost three times greater than in 2019.  Following the huge success of Beyond Meat, investors have high expectations for alt-meat startups and are investing in a range of companies. Well-established brands such as Impossible Foods, Oatly, and Memphis Meats are still receiving the most funding. However, there are some less well-known players such as Nature’s Fynd, which makes protein from volcanic microbes. The company recently raised $80 million. A range of investors are providing funding to companies in this sector, from venture capital companies and pension funds to individuals and major food brands. Already a fast-growing industry, sales of meat alternatives have boomed still further in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Many consumers are concerned about the link between meat processing and the virus. However, this doesn’t necessarily make alt-meat companies a safe investment. There are many competing startups, and not all will go on to be the next Beyond Meat. “At the end of the day to reach scale in this space, you have to deliver something that is as tasty as meat to get consumers to switch,” Marisa Drew of Credit Suisse Group told Bloomberg International.

We reported yesterday that Unilever has pioneer status accredited by the FAIRR Initiative, for its commitment to shifting its food portfolios away from animal-based.  Part of the criteria for achieving pioneer status in the FAIRR report was that the company has an active R&D programme focused on alternative proteins and it demonstrates evidence of using multiple strategies to expand its product portfolio. The latest news from Unilever came yesterday as it announced its partnership with biotech start-up Algenuity. Algenuity is working on Chlorella Vulgaris, a widely recognised (micro)algae,  which is a nutrient-rich, plant-based source of protein and fibre, with a low environmental footprint. It is also very green and bitter tasting but Algenuity has developed technology to overcome these foibles, for example, Its Chlorella Colours® palette significantly reduces the chlorophyll content of microalgae whilst retaining its nutrients. Manfred Aben, VP Science & Technology R&D and Site Leader of Hive, Unilever’s Global Foods Innovation Centre, in Wageningen stated for a news release: “We are very excited about the huge potential working with Algenuity brings to advance nutritious foods that taste great and are a force for good. Transitioning to a sustainable food system requires all of us to work together. It’s one of the world’s greatest challenges and will not happen without partnerships and collaborations. This is what our Hive ecosystem is all about. We are delighted to welcome Algenuity to our community.” Andrew Spicer, CEO and Founder of Algenuity also commented: “We are delighted to partner with Unilever on this. Our Chlorella Colours® platform provides plant-based ingredients that are sustainable, natural, non-GM and protein-rich with neutral flavours. They are also vegan-friendly making them extremely relevant for today’s growing consumer appetite for more plant-based foods with additional functional benefits.”    "

The Israeli food-tech innovator described the collaboration with Migros on its new yogurt line as “a significant milestone for InnovoPro in Europe.”  As we reported last week, Migros is well-positioned in the plant-based food sector, as it has over 500 certified vegan products in stock and just launched its own vegan brand V-Love. In December 2018, the company, which is ranked 14th among the largest retailers in Europe, has already invested in InnovoPro, leading a $4,25 million founding round. The Migros-exclusive line of chickpea protein yogurts is now the first collaboration between the retail giant and the food-tech startup. InnovoPro, which recently raised $15 million, developed an innovative 70% chickpea protein concentrate (chickpea naturally contains 20% protein) generated in a production process resulting in a non-GMO, non-allergenic, gluten-free chickpea protein with no aftertaste. The company’s chickpea protein is the first of its type, incorporated into new products launched by companies worldwide. The Migros-exclusive yogurt line which comes in three natural, vanilla and tropical fruits, includes oats. Further yogurt lines are currently being worked on by both companies and are about to launch in several European countries later this year.  CEO of InnovoPro, Taly Nechushtan, added: “We believe that InnovoPro will lead the new alternative protein category and with partners like ELSA-Mifroma, introduce products with added health and nutritional values to customers. As part of our sustainable growth strategy, we are exploring production collaboration options for our protein, to expand our EU supply chain.”    "

Leading the next phase of production, Dr. James Clark, former CTO of PredictImmune, has been appointed as Chief Scientific Officer to scale the cultivated meat process. James has successfully led the development of biotech and pharma products from discovery to commercialisation to IPO. With over 25 years of experience in R&D and +70 patents, the appointment is a major accomplishment for the Higher Steaks. Speaking with vegconomist today about Higher Steaks’ developments, CEO Benjamina Bollag said, “We’re working hard on making this prototype a commercial product as soon as possible. We’re extremely excited to now have Dr. James Clark in our team. With his expertise of having done this many times through, we’re confident our path to market will only accelerate.” Dr. Ruth Helen Faram, Head of R&D, said to vegconomist. “I’m thrilled to be sharing the work I’ve been doing over the last few months. Using the cell’s natural potential to turn into meat cells is a no-brainer and there are very few fields as exciting as this!” In a statement to the press, Ms. Bollag said further, “The production of the first-ever cultivated bacon and pork belly is proof that new techniques can help meet the overwhelming demand for pork products globally. This is a major milestone for Higher Steaks, we have made substantial advancements in a relatively short amount of time whilst managing cashflow. We are accelerating the development of cultured pork products and the company is now focused on the next steps to bring our products to everyone’s homes.”    "

The GFI’s Executive Director Bruce Freidrich calls this a “game-changer for the industry” and that he hopes the US and Russia compete against each other in this arena.  The Russian announcement was made on the same day that Beyond Fried Chicken debuted in 50+ of its Southern California locations. KFC is actively and globally seeking solutions to provide animal-free options in its menus, whether for reasons of sustainability or profit – one can of course make assumptions. The Good Food Institute Executive Director, Bruce Friedrich, contacted us with a statement, commenting: “KFC’s moves in Russia to bioprint nuggets made of real chicken grown directly from the cell, coupled with its Beyond Fried Chicken launch in Southern California, could mark one of the most significant moments of 2020 for alternative proteins. “KFC has rocketed ahead in the race to recreate meat, positioning itself to be the world’s first restaurant chain to bring real chicken grown directly from the cell to consumers. It’s remarkable and inspiring to see KFC-Russia investing in new ways of making meat. The U.S. needs to catch up and we hope it creates something like the space race but focused on growing healthy and sustainable meat from cells in a cost-effective manner and bringing that meat to the world.” Mr Friedrich concludes:  “KFC is synonymous with chicken, and so it is exciting to see the chain rethinking what chicken means. As one of the most iconic restaurant brands in the world, when KFC talks, the worldwide meat industry listens. So we think this could be a game-changer for the industry.”    "

The US Agri Giant recently acknowledged that the shape of the food industry is changing towards plant-based, and it has been keen to establish a foothold. In early July Cargill launched its plant-based protein brand PlantEver in China, with plant-based chicken nuggets and beef patties. These are available on leading B2C e-commerce platform Tmall, with other online and offline channels to follow. More recently, Cargill also launched another wave of products in partnership with convenience store chain Lawson; these products are plant-based shellfish sandwiches and chicken burritos and are currently available in Lawson’s 600+ outlets in Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu province, according to the GFIC consulting Linkedin page, which also states that this marks the first plant-based seafood retail launch. These plant-based protein products are produced locally in Cargill’s facilities in Chuzhou, Anhui Province. The launch of PlantEver represents an important step for Cargill as local and international companies see the huge market potential in a region whose animal farming industry has been decimated by swine flu and more recently, COVID-19. Managing Director of Cargill Protein China Jackson Chan stated: “Cargill is taking an inclusive approach to the future of protein by investing in both animal and alternative protein. We will continue to offer safe, responsible and sustainable proteins to customers and consumers by flexing our supply chain advantage and global research and development expertise.”    "

Closes Oversubscribed Seed Round Led by Stray Dog Capital,https://vegconomist.com/startups/breaking-grounded-foods-co-closes-oversubscribed-seed-round-led-by-stray-dog-capital/,2020-07-13,"Grounded Foods Co, producer of unique first-to-market cheeses created with cauliflower, today announces to vegconomist the closing of its first Series Seed round which was led by Stray Dog Capital.  The round brought in  $1.74M with participation from Rocana Ventures, Veg Invest Trust and members of the GlassWall Syndicate.       Grounded‘s portfolio of plant-based cheeses free from dairy, nuts, soy, gluten and GMOs, was created by award-winning Australian chef Shaun Quade and the company is headed by his wife Veronica Fil. Grounded uses fermented and upcycled cauliflower and hemp seeds to create cheeses that are not only delicious but low cost, scalable, and nutrient-dense.  Originally from Australia, the couple now operate from LA after a short spell in New York. Veronica spoke to vegconomist in April when online pre-sales sold out within 3 minutes of the shop going live. On launching presales during lockdown, Fil stated, “We really want to ensure that Big Dairy isn’t the only choice left on the shelves once COVID-19 is over.” Click here for a photo gallery of Grounded’s portfolio “We are always looking for extraordinary players in the plant-based cheese category, and Grounded’s product and team exceeded our expectations in taste, creativity and strategy” said Johnny from Stray Dog Capital.  Since 2014, Stray Dog Capital has been investing in early-stage startups and companies that are driving healthier, humane, and more sustainable outcomes predominantly around the plant-based and cultivated meat categories. Grounded’s cheeses can be produced at scale without the ethical or environmental concerns often involved with the production of nut-based cheeses.  Speaking to vegconomist today of the seed funding, Co-founder Veronica Fil says: “Fundraising is never an easy process—and doing it during a global pandemic really takes that challenge to the next level. So to be in a position where we had to turn down investors, simply because we were oversubscribed, feels like an enormous achievement in this environment. But I also think it’s reflective of the growth and opportunity in this category—and the broader plant based economy. We ended up bringing together an incredible mix of investors, who share our vision to make plant based cheese more accessible, and more appealing, to everyday consumers. I’m delighted to have Stray Dog Capital, VegInvest, Rocana Ventures and our GlassWall Syndicate members behind us.”    "

It has invested a further €5 million, which will help Mosa Meat scale up its production of cultured meat.  The company says it aims to gain European regulatory approval for its cultured beef by 2022, and the new funding will help it to achieve this. If it succeeds, it will be the first European company to bring a cultured meat product onto the market. The capital will also go towards the construction of Mosa Meat’s pilot production facility and help it to develop and scale its technology. Bell Food Group says it is investing in Mosa Meat because it recognises the issues surrounding conventional meat production. “According to a number of studies, global meat consumption will rise significantly by around 3% per year up to 2030,” said a spokesperson for the company. “Current production methods will no longer be able to sustainably meet this increase in demand.” Clean meat is predicted to have a 10 percent market share by 2030, and a promising recent study found that most participants preferred the taste of clean meat to that of conventional meat. Earlier this year, a German study also found that almost 50 percent of young educated consumers are open to cultured meat. Bell Food Group originally invested in Mosa Meat in 2018, contributing €2 million. All the planned scientific milestones have since been achieved, giving the meat processing company the confidence to invest further. “We are very excited and grateful to have the support of such an acknowledged and influential industry leader,” said Maarten Bosch, CEO of Mosa Meat. “Having Bell Food Group as our partner gives us confidence that we can achieve our plan to bring cultivated beef to market in 2022.”    "

An initial sum of 40 million RMB (around $5.5M) over the next four years with up to 160M RMB potential follow-up has been revealed.  The alternative protein industry in China is of huge interest due to food security issues raised in recent years. Local and international plant-based brands are vying for a foothold in the nascent stages of a food revolution and food tech in the region is taking shape with government officials calling for a national strategy to enable the country to keep up with the progress made in foreign countries, specifically in cell-based meat. The fund is supported by Lever Foods, a Shanghai-based consultancy that advises on the alternative protein space. Its corporate partners include the venture capital arms of F&B leaders COFCO and Yili, national industry trade group the China Plant-Based Foods Alliance, Givaudan, and Cremer, among others. The Lever China Alternative Protein Fund will invest 40 million RMB over the next four years in entrepreneurs and early-stage alternative protein companies focusing on the burgeoning mainland Chinese market. Brinc will provide a comprehensive three-month accelerator program on a rolling basis for interested portfolio companies, at their new 3,500 sqm space in Guangzhou. Up to 160 million RMB is available in potential follow-on funding from the Lever VC Fund, for a total available investment pool of 200 million RMB.

This latest funding marks a total of US$7.6 million of investment to date for the producer of cultured seafood. We spoke to Shiok Meat’s founder and CEO Dr. Sandhya Sriram about the news.  The startup, which focuses on cell-based shrimp, will utilise the investment to establish a production facility in Singapore and plans to commercialize business in the next two to three years, as first reported by techasia.com, with hopes of reducing the production costs for a kg of cultured shrimp from the current $5,000 to a target of $50. Speaking with vegconomist today, Dr. Sriram said, “We at Shiok Meats are happy for the continued support and encouragement from investors and the industry. The COVID pandemic has further confirmed the need for alternative proteins and we truly believe that cell-based seafood is the way to go!” In an interview with vegconomist in January 2019, the CEO said that her aim is to be the market leader for cellbased seafood, and that regarding the future she believes that ” cell-based meat will replace “traditional” meat – but probably in 10 or 15 years time. If it does not, we are not going to have enough meat to feed the world if produced in the traditional way.

The country’s pork industry was decimated with Swine Flu and consumers appear to be ready for change; China needs alternative protein, so what about cell-based meat?  Chinese media reported last  November that Nanjing Agricultural University had produced five grams of meat cultured from animal muscle stem cells. Beijing’s English language news network China Global Television Network stated, “China currently lacks the regulatory framework to deal with cultivated meat, and experts are calling for policymakers to catch up with technological progress. In September, industry players, lobbyists and government representatives gathered in Beijing to discuss labelling and regulations for cell- and plant-based meat.” Now seven months on, a member of the CPPCC in China (The National Committee of the Chinese People Political Consultative Conference) has spoken out in a high-level plenary meeting with the NPC (National People’s Congress), to raise the point that China needs a national strategy if it is to keep up with other countries that are making progress in the field of cell-based meat, according to Global Meat News. “Cell-based meat is being viewed as the most likely solution to meat supply via clean and sustainable means”, was one of the comments made by Sun Baoguo, who is also the President of the Beijing Technology and Business University. We reported in April that Frontiers had studied consumers in China, India and the USA to gauge their perceptions of “clean”, or cultured meat, and the study found that China is very important in terms of the potential in future market and that initial interest for consumers is higher in China than it is the USA. GlobalMeatNews goes on to state that Sun gave a wide a variety of suggestions to push ahead in this sector, including increased investments in R&D. He also commented: “It will be important to establish and perfect the regulatory systems and laws governing cell-based meat production. Here we can borrow from the US system for monitoring, supervision and responsibility division when it comes to strengthening the safety aspects of seed cells, the animals these are obtained from, the culture process and to analyse the (overall food safety aspects of producing and consuming) cell-based meat”.

11158,Germany’s Opportunity to Prevent Future Meat Scandals by Becoming a Leader in Cultivated Meat,https://vegconomist.com/science/germanys-opportunity-to-prevent-future-meat-scandals-by-becoming-a-leader-in-cultivated-meat/,2020-06-25,"The large German slaughterhouses repeatedly hit the headlines because of their working conditions, especially during the corona crisis. A scientific paper, written at WHU – Otto Beisheim School of Management, shows how Germany could avoid this and become an international leader in this sector in the coming years.  The ongoing meat scandals provide Germany with the right opportunity to become a pioneer in the field of food cultivated from animal cells. The crisis has now revealed that the industry has a major problem. This problem is an expression of the desire of a constantly growing world population to consume meat. At the same time, the mass production of meat brings with it major ethical and safety problems, not only animals and the environment suffer, but also the employees of the companies. The fact that this mass production is increasingly viewed critically also presents an opportunity, as a scientific paper written at the Chair of Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Technological Transformation at WHU – Otto Beisheim School of Management shows. Supervised by Prof. Dr. Dries Faems, the study provides evidence that Germany has the potential to become the world leader in the production of meat from animal cell cultures in the coming years. The authors Julia Schimanietz and Gilda Lukacs have collected numerous qualitative and quantitative data from the USA and the EU. They come to the conclusion that the time would be particularly favourable in Germany to become the leader in the production of cultured meat. They give several reasons for this, least of all, Germany already has a strong base of start-ups (e.g. Planetary Foods, Innocent Meat, Alife Foods, Peace of Meat) that drive the development of meat bred in the laboratory. In order to be successful in the production of cultivated meat, the researchers stress that non-governmental organisations are essential as centres of networking. In addition, the Federal Government must become active with a clear legal framework for the entire production chain. This could not only reduce the uncertainties for startups, but also increase the attractiveness for investors. If the players mentioned above were to cooperate more closely, the chances are good that Germany could become one of the leading nations in the production of meat bred in the laboratory and thus avoid future scandals in the slaughterhouse sector. The results of the authors Julia Schimanietz and Gilda Lukacs were developed in the context of the bachelor thesis “A Systematic Comparison of the US and EU Startup Ecosystems of Cultivated Meat” supervised by Prof. Dr. Dries Faems at the Chair of Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Technological Transformation.

The platform is designed to link up, support, educate and promote businesses, consumers and investors in the plant-based world.  CEO John Creaton explained to FoodNavigator that researching and surfacing more plant-based products at an affordable price is a core objective. Key to increasing volume and making more affordable products available to the mainstream consumer is guidance, involvement with retailers and producers and support of the full product development life cycle. As we reported in May, The Good Food Institute’s state of the industry report was recently released revealing there was a record $824M invested in alternative protein companies in 2019 and $930M invested just in the first quarter of this year. SPINS data showed that plant-based meat retail sales grew to $939 million last year, and this growth significantly accelerated at the beginning of the global pandemic. Mr Creaton added: “The sustainability market can be very confusing. Even the most straightforward products can have very complex supply chains and it is difficult to know how to make the best choice as a business or as a consumer. Our goal is to make that a lot easier in applying our principles and impact criteria to businesses and products that we support. We only work with companies and products that have the ability to scale in order to serve the needs of all consumers wanting to consume more sustainably. We do this by including plant-based products from companies that come with sufficient transparency, quality, ethics and at a reasonable price.”    "

The company states that with its launch, “Karana is re-imagining Asian Food”, starting with its shredded and minced plant meat for foodservice outlets.  According to Food Navigator Asia, the company believes that sourcing young organic jackfruit and having a minimal processing approach to product innovation will enable it to stand out from the crowd. The articles states that Karana is further differentiating itself from other plant-based alternatives by focusing on the ready to cook and ready to eat market, with what it expects to be its signature development; jackfruit based pork Char Siew Bao.  After the initial Singapore launch, Karana has its sights set on the rest of the APAC region before it looks beyond to Western markets. Singapore is well placed for this; as we reported in March – the city-state is emerging as the food tech ecosystem of Asia with its governmental support for alternative protein. Singapore does not have the land space to farm animals at scale and the atrocities brought in by importing animal meat in recent years, e.g. swine flu, have further distanced consumers from animal meat. Karana’s source of jackfruit, is highly sustainable and needs little water, in fact since the fruit is so large, often large amounts are surplus; “upwards of 60% of the world’s jackfruit crop goes to waste as there is just too much of it and it uses very little water to grow too”. The fruit is also low-GI, high in fibre and potassium. Karana’s co-founder and co-CEO, Blair Crichton, told Food Navigator: “The meat market is huge and can fit many players – the objective with these meat alternatives should be to take a share of the market from the meat sector, and not so much compete with other plant-based meat firms.”    "

Can you tell us about the motivation behind Eat Beyond Global?
We are focused on finding and investing in the next great companies creating innovative food products that are more sustainable and healthy. This includes plant-based foods and other innovations in dairy, eggs, meat and seafood. What are you aiming for as a company and how do you hope to achieve it?
For so long, the food industry has been driven by artificial and unsustainable practices that do not match our public health and environmental goals. Now I think we are seeing a transition on a macro level to a more proactive, and perhaps enlightened culture. We are working to support the entrepreneurs that are finding ways to provide alternatives for people that are healthier and more sustainable. We have seen a similar transition taking place when you look at “big pharma” and the opioid crisis in North America and how it is being disrupted by the medicinal CBD/THC industry. How do you assess the current market for the alternative protein industry?
The Good Food Institute showed that over $17 billion has been invested in the plant-based and alternative food industry to date. There are several factors driving this growth including increased awareness of the health benefits of these foods, new food innovation and awareness of the food industry’s impact on the environment – think factory farming.  Why is your platform an important contribution to the food industry?
The average investor has limited opportunity to participate in the growth of the fast-growing plant-based alternative food sector because many of the companies that are getting attention on the store shelves are privately held. This is where Eat Beyond Global comes in – our team of advisors and analysts vet and perform due diligence on each company so the retail investor can get involved in the growth with less of a risk factor. Can you give us an idea of the scale of your platform?
We are a Global Fund that is open to any company that fits our criteria regardless of its country of origin. Each investment opportunity is different and is assessed on a case by case basis. Why is now the time for your investment platform to be a success?
Demand for plant-based alternatives is high and growing, 32% of Americans consider themselves “flexitarians,” which means that they still eat meat but are opting for more meatless alternatives. The plant-based meat market is estimated at around $12.8 billion and is expected to grow to $27.9B by 2025. This is driven by many factors, beyond just animal welfare. This includes the attractive health, environmental, and food security benefits related to plant-based alternatives. COVID-19 has also brought greater awareness to the main source of infectious diseases in humans, which is called Zoonosis, the transfer of disease from livestock and other animals to humans. Most of our common diseases are of animal origin, bird flu comes from domestic chickens and influenza originated in horses and pigs for example. Other diseases with similar origins include chicken pox, swine flu, tuberculosis and now COVID-19 which originated from bats. This is a trend that is likely to become increasingly devastating to public health, and the answer is really to reduce our dependence on animal products. What is your current portfolio?
While I cannot share specifics just yet –  we look at companies on a case-by-case basis. We target companies ranging from run rates of $20m to $200m. Some of the companies we are looking at are at present more R&D-focused at present, such as companies developing growth media and cultured meat in the cellular agriculture industry.  How do you see your platform shaping the future of the plant-based industry?
Eat Beyond Global is positioned as a key partner for future portfolio brands because of our strict focus on the industry, as well as our team. We have put together a team of industry veterans to help us evaluate the potential of the companies we speak to. This includes: One of the key categories in your primary focus of investments is with cellular agriculture. Please tell us how this fits into your scope.
Cell agriculture is an area that is more in the R & D stages. We like this area because at some point in the next few years it will likely be the most disruptive category in the food industry. The race is on now to find the most cost-effective process and several companies we are talking to are getting close. What are the most exciting developments that you are witnessing?
We are looking at all categories but initially focussing on alternatives to egg, meat, dairy, seafood including plant-based protein, fermented food, cultured agriculture, food tech and cell agriculture. There are many new exciting companies. Cellular agriculture and growth media, the growth media is what cell agriculture takes place in is definitely a fascinating area.  With cell agriculture a chicken breast can be produced from just a single cell, no live animal is required. Another standout area is innovative uses of traditional plant-based ingredients to create new products, for example, the creation of egg alternatives using mung beans. What do you think the future of our food industry will look like?
Well, I am hoping that the food industry will not only help to advance human health overall, but it will improve our environmental inefficiencies, help protect our planet from climate change, and improve animal welfare. It will take time, but if we all do our part I think we can make it happen.    "
11217,Faunalytics: “Companies That Exploit or Harm Animals Spend Millions of Dollars on Research – We are Here to Level the Information Playing Field”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/faunalytics-companies-that-exploit-or-harm-animals-spend-millions-of-dollars-on-research-we-are-here-to-level-the-information-playing-field/,2020-06-11,"Faunalytics is a unique NGO that helps people to help animals by providing essential research and resources to organisations, with the wonderful tagline, “Animals Need You. You Need Data.” Faunalitycs seeks to save animals using research and data to empower vegan businesses and advocates. The organisation, based in Olympia, Washington, says it strengthens the animal protection movement by helping advocates and vegan business leaders better understand how people think about and respond to animal issues. The work carried out here is highly rele,vant to vegan brands, for example their labeling study What To Call Plant-Based Alternatives is highly pertinent to those marketing new plantbased products. Faunalytics is also currently researching methods for meat reduction in China, a subject at the top of the agenda for countless figures in the plantbased business world at present. We were fascinated to speak with Executive Director Brooke Haggerty, a lady with more than a decade of experience in the nonprofits who has dedicated her entire career to protecting animals. Hi Brooke, please introduce Faunalytics and tell our readers what you do.
We offer three key areas of support: we conduct original research studies to explore important questions facing our movement; we maintain an online library of over 4,000 external research summaries on a variety of animal issues; and we provide personalized support to advocates, academics, and vegan business owners via our weekly office hours. Our resources are used to influence individuals, companies, policies, and laws. When armed with data-driven insight to guide their strategies, vegan businesses are better positioned to succeed. How does Faunalytics support the vegan movement (and specifically vegan business owners)?
As an NGO, all of Faunalytics’ research and resources are free for everyone. Our original research program prioritizes study topics that have the potential to impact many animals. Therefore, a significant portion of our projects focus on farmed animal issues and veganism. The research questions that we address are often directly relevant to the vegan business community, which shares many of the same priorities as advocates from the nonprofit sector (such as understanding your target audience and identifying successful messaging strategies). Additionally, our research library is a treasure trove of information that can help vegan business owners understand and capitalize on trends in their industry. For restaurant owners, our blog Increasing the Appeal of Plant-Based Dishes provides useful insight on the importance of naming dishes, meal presentation, bias against food descriptors, and how to navigate meat substitutes with meat-eaters. For entrepreneurs and other business owners, our article Follow The Money, Part 1: Current Trends in Plant-Based Investment provides an overview of investment in plant-based companies, start-ups, and innovations, and includes a list of venture capital funds focused exclusively on investment in new plant-based companies and research efforts. Why is data important for vegan businesses and leaders? How can it help the movement grow?
Companies that exploit or harm animals spend millions of dollars on research, marketing, and advertising – we are here to level the information playing field. They know how to persuade people to buy things and they know how to sway public opinion to their advantage. This is where consumer research and data come in. Research suggests that highly data-driven organizations are three times more likely to report significant improvements in decision-making. McKinsey and Company reports that data-driven organizations are 23 times more likely to acquire customers, 6 times as likely to retain customers, and 19 times as likely to be profitable. Organizations that use consumer behavior insights strategically are outperforming their peers by 85% in sales growth margins. Vegan business owners who may not consider themselves “advocates” can still use research to help our movement grow. For example, Faunalytics recently published a case study detailing the power of framing menus with a veg default, how options with and without a veg protein differ, and how veg consumption may be rising. Our findings suggest that restaurants that aren’t exclusively vegan should consider using more veg defaults on their menus to increase veg purchases (and possibly profit margins). In fact, research tells us that simply offering more veg meals increases vegetarian meal consumption and decreases meat consumption. You’re turning your attention to meat reduction in China…what do you hope to learn?
When considering animal suffering from a global perspective, it’s clear that current animal advocacy resources are disproportionately allocated to Western countries, yet production and consumption of animals used for food are on the rise elsewhere. A staggering 89.1 billion land animals were slaughtered worldwide in 2017 according to data from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. China slaughtered the largest number of land animals (more than 14.2 billion), with the United States coming in second (more than 9.4 billion). Though it’s important to note that accounting for differences in population, consumption in the U.S. is still higher than in China. Our research project will help identify cultural barriers and opportunities to decrease the suffering of these animals in China. In partnership and consultation with local animal advocacy groups, we’ll identify the barriers and supports for specific advocacy methods before testing them experimentally. Effective research—just like effective advocacy—will require a sensitive understanding of the unique cultural associations and traditions around meat, dairy, and egg consumption. Vegan business leaders can use our findings to learn how to best position products in new markets with alternative consumer attitudes, beliefs, concerns, and preferences. Tell us something you have learned from your recent studies which is relevant to the plant-based industry.
We know that understanding your target audience is a vital first step to any business marketing strategy, and we’ve outlined detailed demographic profiles of veg consumers. But understanding your consumers is only part of the equation. Equally important is understanding how to communicate with them, and what they intend to do. Our labeling study What To Call Plant-Based Alternatives found that although the term plant-based has risen in popularity, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to labeling. This means that while packaging must be fairly standardized, targeting messages to specific groups is the smartest strategy. Our study outlined how various demographics respond to various labels so vegan businesses can apply our findings directly to their clientele base. We suspect that most vegan business owners are also paying close attention to how animal welfare dynamics are unfolding in general, and how the public is responding to changes in animal welfare standards. For example, our study on the Impact of Corporate Commitments on Public Attitudes found that concerns about consumer choice restrictions were quite rare on the topic of cage-free egg requirements. Knowing how consumers are reacting to welfare changes can help us capitalize on support, anticipate concerns, and navigate next steps.  Finally, we recently conducted a poll on the public’s understanding of COVID-19’s relationship with animals. The proportion of people who said they were more likely to try plant-based eating or reduce their meat consumption because of the pandemic was roughly similar to the proportion who said they were less likely to do so. This suggests that average meat consumption may remain similar, but it also implies that there are potentially new customers out there willing to try plant-based products. What studies do you have in the pipeline that vegan businesses should be aware of?
Faunalytics has several studies in progress that will support the efforts of vegan business owners and advocates alike. For example, our upcoming survey on trends in veganism will help us get to the bottom of how our primary audience is growing. This study is important because we need to measure our audience repeatedly, precisely, accurately, and comparably if we want to understand how the plant-based industry is changing and rising in popularity. We’re also conducting a longitudinal study looking at how new veg*ns transition to and maintain their new diets in the crucial early months. We’re examining which habits, tools, and resources help people stick with the diet over time, so that we know how to better support and retain as many new veg*ns as possible. Additionally, we’re working on identifying which forms of animal products are most heavily consumed for food in the United States in order to identify the impact of each type of food on animal lives. The goal is to provide an ordered list of the products with the greatest potential impact if meat-eaters replaced them with plant-based or cultivated substitutes.  Does Faunalytics have other insights about the plant-based market that we should know?
Businesses with a focus on vegan cosmetics or products will benefit from our exploring studies in our research library, which suggest that only 33% of people say they have ever purchased a product labeled as “not tested on animals.” Rather, consumers favor ‘cruelty free’ and ‘natural’ product claims and 43% said they’d be willing to pay more for beauty products that aren’t tested on animals). If your business caters to clients with companion animals, I’d recommend reviewing our interactive Companion Animal Fundamentals for an overview of the landscape as you think about scaling your business. For those in the cultivated meat space our study on Naturalness Concerns and Clean Meat Acceptance found that providing consumers with positive messaging about the benefits and characteristics of clean meat may be the most effective way to address the “naturalness concern.” For vegan business owners with questions about research and data that we didn’t cover today, I invite you to reach out to us for free, personalized support. You can also subscribe to receive our research updates or visit our website at www.faunalytics.org to see what we’re up to! We’re here to empower fellow vegans in our collective effort to end animal suffering.    "

11239,EABA: “Algae are an Extraordinary Source for Healthy Nutrition. Natural. Nutritious. Sustainable. This is How Our Future Food Should Be”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/eaba-algae-are-an-extraordinary-source-for-healthy-nutrition-natural-nutritious-sustainable-this-is-how-our-future-food-should-be/,2020-06-08,"Algae has been shown in tests and studies to be not only extremely protein-dense but also highly sustainable. Algae and microalgae are being increasingly utilised around the world for myriad applications such as clothes, medicines, protein supplements, cosmetics and skincare, and increasingly in the production of plantbased meat and fish.  On 30th June 2020 there will be an online webinar “Algae based Fish and Meat” which is organised by the European Algae Biomass Association. We were extremely interested to speak with Alexandra Mosch, VP of EABA and Board Member at BLU EAT about the fascinating world of this nutritional powerhouse which could be our food of the future. Why is biomass from algae well suited for substitutes to fish and meat?
Worldwide there is a pressing need for alternative protein to fight the climate crisis while preserving our environment, without deforestation or overfishing. Algae deliver this sustainable plant-based protein for food  – and even more healthy nutritional ingredients. Algae have been at the origin of the vegetal and the animal world 3.5 billion years ago. They contain all building blocks of life, meaning all nutritional ingredients we require including the ones we get from meat and fish consumption like protein, trace elements (iron, zinc) or Vitamins (B6, B12). The protein from algae can be very well digested by us humans, which is evident through their favourable PDCAAS (protein digestibility corrected amino acid score), for comparison the Spirulina algae is at 0,85, Galderia algae at 0,92, beef is at 0,92 and pea at 0,6. Algae provide so-called “complete” protein which means they contain all polyunsaturated fatty acids. Most importantly they are the primary producer of the long chain fatty acids which only algae can build (unique Omega-3 (like DHA and EPA)). Fish does also contain such healthy Omega-3, but only because they eat the algae. And actually also other properties like colour, taste and smell of the fish are influenced by their food – the algae – when coming from the wild (and not industrially farmed). Using the algae biomass directly and convert it into (alternative) fish but also into meat products is therefore in several properties already very close to the end-product we are used to consuming. In addition it helps to save several steps of industrial fish farming or industrial production of livestock, therefore is providing for all the favourable nutritional profile but being less pollutant and better for our environment. So obviously algae are an extraordinary source for healthy nutrition and best suited for alternative products to fish and meat. Natural. Nutritious. Sustainable. This is how our future food should be. Which companies are already using these / applying algae-based solutions?
Numerous companies from the vegan and the algae industry are developing algae-based fish and meat products to meet the quickly increasing consumer demand of vegans, vegetarians and flexitarians. Some products have already been introduced to the market or are shortly before market entry. To give some examples: the sausages with algae by Viva Maris/Germany (sold in German-speaking retail), the smoked salmon with algae by Odontella/France (sold all over Europe) or the BluFin Tuna Sashimi by Kuleana/USA (in development). And there are more. Can price points of “real” meat and fish be achieved with the algae alternatives?
Yes, of course. Algae products are not only absolutely competitive in costs to animal or other plant-based alternatives – but even superior. The technologies for algae production at industrial scale exist, they have been developed. Therefore there are no bottlenecks for providing high volumes at a reasonable and comparable cost profile for industrial volumes. Furthermore the utilisation of such biomass may save industrial process steps with CO2 output AND is mitigating CO2 with every kilogram of algae production, therefore much more beneficial for our environment. The discussion on how to “price” carbon capture is still ongoing, but it will soon be implemented. Taking this fact of carbon credits for which companies will have to pay in future into consideration and into the calculation of the “full-costs” of an end-consumer-ready product, this should easily show that algae-based products are superior in costs by far.   What about the life cycle assessment?
Algae grow by doing photosynthesis. They do only need sunlight, CO2, some water and some nutrients. Therefore they contribute positively to the LCA of any end-consumer-ready product. To feed the world, to produce sufficient protein for all humans, we will have to build a lot more production facilities. We will have more positive impact with e.g. microalgae production in vertical farming of in bio-refinery concepts. And the increase of macroalgae production will help to re-forest coastlines and re-establish bio marine diversity. But of course for both, offshore and onshore production at an industrial scale, all stakeholders will have to ensure and contribute to support sustainable practices over the whole life-cycle. What development do you expect in the coming years?
Algae will develop into a mainstream biomass, ingredient and function provider for the New Agri-Food sector with sustainable and nutritious products. The consumer demand for food which is developed and produced with respect to the environment, with the most beneficial CO2 footprint and best possible nutritional profile is increasing. Therefore I expect a boom in investments in algae SME’s in the short term followed by a boom in algae-based product offering, also in the area of algae-based fish and meat, soon and at global scale. To secure the biomass availability and increase the positive impact on our climate, I expect that we will see huge offshore macroalgae production areas and at the same time land-bound seaweed production in deserts, in industrial or rural areas. Furthermore, I expect a boom in the microalgae-production also land-bound in industrial buildings, but as well as to be integrated in the “city-of-the-future” concepts, to be grown on rooftops as well as on facades of buildings to be directly harvested and converted by 3D-printing into food products.

11240,"V Meat, a Partnership Between JAT Energy & Oppenheimer, Commences its Plan to Take on Plant-Based Meat Market in China",https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/v-meat-a-partnership-between-jat-energy-oppenheimer-commences-its-plan-to-take-on-plant-based-meat-market-in-china/,2020-06-08,"Australia’s V Meat has begun its planned crusade into Asia. The brand was established in October 2019 as part of a strategy in place under the partnership of JAT (Jatenergy Limited) and Oppenheimer Pty Ltd, with a plan to capitalise on the massive market potential in Asia for alternative protein.  Western giants in the vegan world have already recognised Asia, and particularly China, as being crucial for the next stage of the game. Stockhead quoted Beyond Meat’s CFO Mark Nelson as stating: “Asia has a desperate need for plant-based meat. So I’m going to be very aggressive in going into those markets”. Whilst within the region, companies like Qishan Foods, OmniFoods, Phuture Foods and Zhenmeats are gearing up to establish their footholds. JAT (Jatenergy Limited), an Australia-Asia trade specialist, entered into an agreement under a joint venture (50/50) with Sydney-based Oppenheimer — a manufacturer and provider of foodservice brands in Australia, New Zealand, India, China, Southeast Asia and Singapore — specifically for the creation of the V Meat brand with a view to target the Asian markets. The products from V Meat will include Wagyu beef, hot pot, pork and beef balls, pork and beef minces, beef burgers and chicken strips, according to AuManufacturing.com. Distributors in China for the V Meat products include Shanghai Xinghualou, Tianjin Guifaxiang Food Group, and large hotel groups. An ASX release published in 2019 acknowledged that there was already growth in the plant-based foods sector and cited interest was due to rising pork prices following the Chinese pig cull, protein shortages generally, vegetarian popularity amongst consumers and improvements of modern plant-based offerings. JAT introduced the plant-based meat project at the second China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai in 2019. The company said it received high exposure to a number of Chinese media outlets. JAT’s CEO and the Chairman of V Meat, Wilton Yao, commented to the Market Herald: “The interest generated for our range of plant-based meats presented to potential buyers at the CIIE was very significant and JAT believes there is a very strong market for the products in China. Potential distributors believed that the timing and opportunity for the sale of our plant-based meat are enhanced as a result of the shortage of pork meat in China as a result of the African swine flu.”    "
11288,Dr. Miles Woodruff From Sophie’s Kitchen on the Incredible Rise of Plant-Based Seafood,https://vegconomist.com/business-insiders/dr-miles-woodruff-from-sophies-kitchen-on-the-incredible-rise-of-plant-based-seafood/,2020-05-28,"Sophie’s Kitchen’s vegan seafood alternatives saw its sales increase 3X in 2019 and says its mission is to “rock the seafood category in the way that Beyond Meat rocked the burger industry.” As the pioneers of plant-based seafood, the brand already has production around the world and is ready to rapidly scale distribution globally.  CEO Miles Woodruff here shares his insights on the industry’s top trends and where it is headed in the future. “We are seeing an explosion of meatless protein startups right now. Beyond Meat’s huge IPO has set off what is comparable to the tech boom of the early 90’s in plant-based foods. A serious investor can’t look at what Beyond Meat did with beef alternatives, and not wonder, “Who is next and how do I get in?” Meat companies are typically responding to this trend by either fighting the change or catching and riding the wave. As an island boy from Oahu, Hawaii I believe it’s better to ride the wave, since fighting a wave isn’t even going to slow it down. It might make a good YouTube video though. Look at the dairy section at any grocery store and you will see its now nearly half plant-based alternatives. It is crazy to think of all the money that was wasted fighting the preferences of consumers who wanted to buy plant-based milks. Around the world, meat producers are recognizing there is no fighting this wave. Pinnacle Foods, now acquired by Conagra, bought Gardein out of Canada. Tyson Foods is jumping into alternative proteins with both feet. The Ponnath Group out of Germany, a 13th generation artisanal meat processing company, has taken a bold stance in support of plant-based foods. They now produce the Wonder Burger which is the top selling plant-based burger in the country. In Asia, Temasek, one of Singapore’s sovereign wealth funds (~$300B), is also investing heavily in alternative protein companies. Smart money understands these trends and is now backing plant-based foods.  As a vegan, I’m happy to see companies join our cause because that energy isn’t put into fighting against us. While in the Congo working for Jane Goodall, I learned you don’t save animals by fighting poachers – you save animals by enrolling those poachers in new opportunities that support positive change. It may have been a while, but most vegans are converts. Conversion is the quickest way to cruelty-free food. People won’t eat plant-based protein alternatives unless they taste amazing. At Sophie’s Kitchen, we spent years creating a seamless seafood experience so that our plant-based proteins are nearly indistinguishable from their animal-based counterparts. Our breaded shrimp and crab cakes are two of our top-selling products because they have an almost identical taste, texture, and look to the real deal. The recent success in vegan foods is driven by plant protein companies mimicking animal-based foods seamlessly. Some of them are so real that vegans won’t even eat them. Veggie burgers were traditionally only eaten by vegans and vegetarians, because no one else wanted to eat them. Now the trend is to focus on creating products that offer similar flavor, texture, smell and look as their non-vegan counterpart. Meatless meats are targeting flexitarians and meat reducers, which is great for the industry. Today, about 40% of the U.S. population has tried plant-based. Documentaries like Game Changers and NGO’s like Veganuary make becoming plant-based fun and attractive. COVID-19 is a global tragedy that has drastically impacted supply chains for meat production companies. The supply chain disruption in animal-based foods has caused an enormous surge in the already booming alternative protein sales. The tides have changed and how people shop has permanently shifted. Once consumers eat their first plant-based meal and find that the world is still turning they are likely to do it again. Buying habits are just that: habits. Meat shortages are driving people to try new plant-based foods, many of those people are very likely to become repeat customers. Additionally, now consumer packaged goods as a category is surging. Everyone has to eat at home and many want to feed their families something that’s been heat treated and is safe from virus contamination. Major retailers and VC’s are putting a lot of energy and money into expediting and automating the home delivery supply chain. Shelf stable and frozen products that can be shipped through Amazon or delivered to your doorstep with Instacart are likely going to continue to do well even after things go back to normal as the result of the changes in consumer behavior. Our canned Toonas, Frozen Fish Fillets, Breaded Shrimp and Crab Cakes can be ordered in this way and are seeing huge increase in demand. Looking further ahead to the future, I believe the plant-based space will continue to innovate protein products that aren’t dependent on weather or geography. I see algae and single cell protein continuing to emerge in the market, while not mainstream quite yet. These types of proteins aren’t subject to weather or geographic constraints because the protein can be produced indoors using food grade byproducts. In 3 days, you get the same amount of protein that you would from three months of growing soy crops, 18 months of raising cattle, or two months raising chickens. Plant protein is arguably healthier because it doesn’t have any cholesterol, hormones, toxins, heavy metals or parasites found in traditional ocean harvested meats. After nearly a decade of work by the Sophie’s Kitchen team, plant-based seafood is a recognized category. For the first time we have started opening to outside investment to keep up with the explosive growth in the category. We are thrilled to see high-energy competitors like Good Catch and New Wave Foods join the movement and work alongside us towards a plant-based future. Conservation is very important to us, and we want to use Sophie’s Kitchen as a platform to spread good to the planet and everyone/everything living on it. Using food technology, we can help change food systems at the core by offering guilt-free products that still taste, look and smell just as good. To date, we have displaced the need to extract between 4 and 10 million tons of oceanic wildlife depending on how bycatch is calculated. That positive impact on the world doesn’t cost investors or retailers anything. Doing good is what motivates us to strive for rapid sustainable growth. Increasing the turns on the shelves of retailers and being an amazing investment opportunity only increases the positive impact we can have. We strive to create alternatives that don’t make people feel bad or shame them for their food choices, but rather simply give them something that tastes as good or even better.”    "
11298,GFI Announces Exciting Research Partnership with Dr. Ori Bar-Nur to Reduce the Cost of Cultured Meat,https://vegconomist.com/science/gfi-announces-exciting-research-partnership-with-dr-ori-bar-nur-to-reduce-the-cost-of-cultured-meat/,2020-05-27,"Despite booming commercial interest in plant-based and cultivated meat, the industries lack the open-access data required to become a viable part of the global food system. The Good Food Institute’s Competitive Research Grant Program is changing that, with $7 million awarded to 35 open-access research initiatives since the program’s inception in 2019. Funded thanks to gifts from visionary donors, the program supports open-access research that advances the science of plant-based and cultivated meat — technologies poised to revolutionize the food system and address the many issues associated with conventional meat production, from food scarcity and climate change to zoonotic disease and antibiotic resistance. Dr. Bar-Nur is an Assistant Professor at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. His research project with the GFI directly converts fibroblasts into induced myogenic progenitor cells as an alternative to conventional methods of growing muscle progenitors, and assesses the capacity of the induced myogenic progenitors to generate muscle fibers by small molecules and serum withdrawal. The project devises new methods of producing animal muscle cell lines and will reduce costs of cultivated meat production via long-term propagation of cell lines.  GFI Executive Director Bruce Friedrich commented: “Plant-based meat and cultivated meat have the potential to transform the global food system, but this requires the industries to overcome significant technical hurdles that remain on the path to price parity, scaleup, and commercialization. Building a robust foundation of open-access data will enable the entire sector to advance more efficiently and bring plant-based and cultivated meat to the masses.”    "
11300,"Air Protein – Creating Meat Out Of Air — “We Have an Ultra-Sustainable, Clean Label Solution for the Future of Meat”",https://vegconomist.com/interviews/airprotein-creating-meat-out-of-air-if-we-cant-curb-consumer-demand-for-meat-we-can-redefine-it/,2020-05-26,"Last autumn, Air Protein created meat out of air. This astonishing company has pioneered a process of producing meat using the elements in the air, converting them into nutrients to form Air Protein flour; a complete protein that contains all nine essential amino acids and with an amino acid profile comparable to animal protein.  We were absolutely fascinated to speak with Dr. Lisa Dyson (click here to view her TED Talk describing the Air Protein Technology), who says, “The future of meat is now. We have an ultra-sustainable solution to the problem that, at scale, will be a clean label, more nutritious and less costly than animal-based meat.” Dr. Dyson’s accolades include: Inc Magazine – Top 100 Female Founders 2019; 2019 Verge Vanguard Award; Most Creative People in Business 2017 by Fast Company; San Francisco Business Times’ Forever Influential Honor Roll; and a C3E award from MIT and the Department of Energy for her entrepreneurial leadership in energy. Please tell us the background to Air Protein
By 2050 the population is expected to reach 10 billion, resulting in a 70% increase in the demand for food production. This means an increased need for land and resources for food production. Current food production accounts for more greenhouse gas emissions than the entire transportation sector, and has led to the clearing of an area of land equivalent to the size of Africa and South America combined. In October 2019, the Air Protein team announced that we had transformed CO2 to develop the world’s first air-based meat – meat made with protein that doesn’t require any arable land. Air Protein uses a process similar to fermentation to make a protein that is rich in vitamins. It is also free from hormones, antibiotics, pesticides, or herbicides. We are focused on demonstrating the versatility of air-based protein to make meat analogues across a variety of categories, including poultry, beef, pork, and seafood. Can you offer a basic explanation of how the technology works?
Like plants, air-based protein uses CO2, which is in the air we breathe, and renewable energy as inputs. Whereas seeds are planted in soil to grow, air-based protein starter cultures grow in water. Crops require months to go from seed to harvest, but air-based protein is ready for harvest in a few short days and the output is a nutritious protein that is rich in all the essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals. To make meat, we apply a combination of pressure, temperature, and culinary techniques to our protein to give it different flavors and textures. In this way, we are able to make delicious analogues to poultry, pork, beef, or seafood. What are Air Protein’s greatest advantages in the alternative protein market?
Sustainability: air-based meat uses a fraction of the environmental footprint versus alternatives. The key ingredient, protein, is made in the most sustainable way to make protein. It does not require any arable land – not for production and not for the inputs. In fact, it would take a soy farm the size of Texas to produce the same amount of protein that one would get from an Air Protein farm the size of Walt Disney World. This independence from arable land means that protein can be made day or night, rain or shine, and in any climate or in any geography. This flexibility can make for a more resilient and secure supply chain.   Versatility: we can make a variety of air-based protein ingredients. We can make ingredients that have different functional properties, which give us flexibility in our applications. With this versatility combined with culinary techniques, we have the potential of making analogues of most types of meat. What is your business model?
Air Protein is pioneering the first air-based meat products for consumers. We will leverage both foodservice and retail channels. We have spent years developing the science to make air-based protein and are now focused on demonstrating the versatility of air-based protein to make meat analogues across a variety of categories. Tell us about the difference in volume of resources needed for the production of your product  compared to conventional meat and other plant-based meat solutions
We are excited about the resource efficiency of our air-based meat production process. If we compare our process with making a steak, for instance, currently it takes 2-3 years to produce a steak from cattle. Lots of agricultural land and water goes into the process, from grazing to feed production. In addition, over the 2+ years, lots of greenhouse gases are emitted.  Making meat from soy is much better and would only require months of inputs for the soybeans, including land and water, to grow, be harvested and the protein extracted. Air-based protein is ready for consumption in just a few short days and has a high conversion efficiency, so minimal inputs are required. To put it in numbers, compared with beef Air Protein uses: What makes air protein flour the most sustainable ingredient?
Hours to produce: like plants, air-based protein uses CO2 and renewable energy to grow. Unlike plants, air-based protein can be produced in a matter of a few short days. Can be deployed anywhere: air-based protein can be farmed vertically with minimal impact on the environment. Production isn’t impacted by weather conditions or seasons. This means air protein farms can be deployed in diverse geographies and climates – from Iowa or Texas to Los Angeles, Montreal or Iceland.  No agricultural land required: air-based protein doesn’t require arable land. This is a huge issue for our current food production system where an area of land equivalent to the area of South America and Africa combined has already been cleared to support this industry. We need solutions that require minimal land in order to scale production to feed 10 billion people by 2050. No natural habitats removed: the requirement for agricultural land in the food industry has led to the removal of rainforests and the natural habitat for a range of animal, plant and insect life. As a result we have seen many species go extinct. In fact, in 2019 Brazil saw record-breaking fires in the Amazon, which was largely to clear land for food production. Uses CO2 vs emitting greenhouse gases: like plants, we use CO2 as an input and renewable energy. This is in contrast to meat production where, for instance, the emissions of a cow is equivalent to the emissions of a car.     When and where will you launch your products?
We will deploy in the US first but will create flavors and textures that have global appeal.

11311,Almost 50% of Younger Educated Consumers in Germany are Open to Cultured Meat,https://vegconomist.com/science/almost-50-of-younger-educated-consumers-in-germany-are-open-to-cultured-meat/,2020-05-25,"A study by the German Academy of Science and Engineering and the Körber Foundation shows that there is still a lot of work to be done for consumers in Germany to fully accept cultured meat before such products arrive onto the market, but highlights that the attitudes vastly differ between age groups.  63.6% of participants in the survey either reject or strongly reject the statement that cultured meat is “a good thing” and 15.7% of those questioned regard it either positively or rather positively. The primary reservation was shown to be one of alienation from the food production process and doubts about its potential for world nutrition and as an ethically acceptable substitution of meat. The respondents were the least concerned about potential health risks. The group which showed the highest rejection rates were female consumers of middle and higher age. The highest acceptance was within younger, better-educated people, especially men. Approximately three quarters of both middle-aged (74.4%) and older women (76.3%) reject laboratory meat. Younger men (31.8%) were the most accepting. Almost half of the younger and better-educated respondents (44.6%) are open to the idea of laboratory meat as a substitute. Older, less educated people often reject laboratory meat as an ethically acceptable alternative (71.1%). In the age group of 16 to 35 years, 38.5% of men but only 24.9% of women agree with it as a substitute. On the other hand, women over 35 years of age were particularly sceptical and the majority of women over 65 years of age in particular see meat renunciation as a solution.      "
11321,Dao Foods: “We are Truly Excited About the Future for Plant-Based Food in China”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/dao-foods-we-are-truly-excited-about-the-future-for-plant-based-food-in-china/,2020-05-21," Dao Foods and NCC also invested in Chinese foodtech company Starfield Food, producer of China’s first and only ground beef analog, which since then has already partnered with six restaurant chains, including Papa John’s, to sell its vegan meat in Chinese foodservice. What is the current focus of Dao Foods?
The mission of Dao Foods is to help entrepreneurs introduce exciting new plant-based and alternative protein products in China to reduce the consumer demand for animal agriculture.  China is the largest consumer market in the world with rapidly rising incomes and increasing meat and dairy consumption, which if left unaddressed will lead to growing negative environmental, food safety, and health impact.  Dao Foods believes that supporting talented entrepreneurs who are targeting the 400m millennials in China with new, exciting, and delicious plant based proteins is a huge business opportunity with massive social impact. We recently launched the Dao Foods Incubator, which will provide startup capital and mentorship to five plant-based and/or alternative protein food companies every six months.  Our plan through the incubator is to help launch 30 exciting companies over the next three years, which we believe will inspire even more talented entrepreneurs into the plant-based sector so we can build the industry together in China.  It takes a village! How do you assess the market for plant-based and alternative protein sources in China?
It is still early days in China.  When you go to restaurants or order online, there is no such thing as a “plant-based” category like there is now in North America and Europe.  That said, things move fast in China, and we are excited with the recent entry of international companies like Beyond Meat into the Chinese market.  We have invested in and been working with Starfield Food and Science Technology for the last year and are excited about their recent product launches at six restaurant chains across China covering hundreds of restaurants.  In fact, it is our work with Starfield that partially inspired us to start the Incubator, seeing how our networks and guidance could help an early stage company grow.  We believe entrepreneurs are the key to innovation and change and want to support them as much as we can with all our resources and the combined expertise of our network both in China and abroad. In your opinion, why should the investment community continue to acknowledge veganism?
We believe that investors are becoming more and more aware of the macro risks related to industrial animal agriculture.  Whether it’s the African Swine Flu, Shrimp disease (Div1), or recent supply chain challenges, smart investors are beginning to understand that industrial animal agriculture is a very inefficient way to satisfy the growing global demand for protein.  It only makes economic sense that the world should diversify its sources of protein and innovate to create more resource-efficient alternative protein products.  Despite the success of companies like Impossible and Beyond Meat, the alternative protein industry is still in the early stages of science and product development, and the products will only get better at conquering the taste buds of mainstream consumers.  Brave entrepreneurs are leading the charge, and with the world’s largest meat and seafood market in China, we believe that smart investors are beginning to recognize the untapped opportunity.  Our conversations about China with investors now are radically different from the conversations we were having two to three years ago.  What is Dao Foods planning to achieve in the short term and in the long term?
Our current focus is on the incubator.  As much as the macro environment discussed above should make the market potential obvious, we believe the best way to show the opportunity is to prove it, through successful and innovative companies.  By supporting and launching five alternative protein food companies every six months, we believe these companies will prove there is market demand and potential in this sector.  Another area of current focus is to engage a small group of forward-looking strategic investors who comprehend this theory of change and who want to engage and get involved in funding these companies earlier on.  The goal of the incubator is to create a collaborative ecosystem of entrepreneurs, investors, and food industry experts who want to learn together and be pioneers in changing the food system.   Why is sustainable food the key to investing in China?
The current food system in China is unsustainable, particularly given projected demand for protein in the coming decades.  Industrial animal agriculture is a very inefficient protein source, and we believe fortunes will be made by those who create more efficient and tasty alternatives to present to consumers. We know that Dao Foods has recently partnered with VC firm New Crop Capital, was this partnership specifically to launch and support the incubator project? Please tell us more about the partnership and its purpose.
Our partners New Crop Capital have been pioneers in the alternative protein sector, funding over 30 companies.  We were mission aligned from the start and believed strongly in their investment thesis and mandate, which Dao Foods is now applying in China.  In our 2+ year partnership with NCC, we have learned a great deal from their experiences, and are combining it with our knowledge and networks in China.  The incubator is just one example of how we will apply the experience, scientific knowledge and networks of our combined team to accelerate plant-based and alternative protein in China. Can you tell us about the vegan startups in your portfolio?
In addition to our investment in Starfield, we have been developing a strong pipeline of companies ranging from soy protein ingredient companies to plant-based chicken, seafood, yogurt, meat snacks, and many other categories. We are truly excited about the future for plant-based food in China.   Why should startups apply to your incubator program?
Dao Foods is laser-focused on China and laser-focused on plant-based and alternative protein.  While an argument could be made to have a broader geographical mandate (e.g. Asia), we believe that China is unique from the rest of Asia and large enough of a market by itself.  An argument could also be made to have a broader set of sectors (e.g. food tech), but we believe that a narrow focus on plant-based food allows us to bring the right resources and networks that have true value for the entrepreneurs.  In short, we don’t want to be distracted by the challenges in other sectors and other geographies.  Plant-based food in China is big enough!  Dao Foods can only be successful in our mission if we are able to support and help companies grow.  We are excited to partner with five talented companies every six months who see value in the Dao Foods network joining their team.     For information about applying to the incubator please see Dao Foods’ call for entrepreneurs     "

The Farm-to-Fork Strategy states that for the EUR 10 billion proposed to be spent on the bioeconomy and food, a key area of research will be “increasing the availability and source of alternative proteins such as plant, microbial, marine and insect-based proteins and meat substitutes”.  The GFI Europe today welcomes the news. GFI Europe Policy Manager, Alexander Holst, said: “This is a major step forward. Alternative proteins, such as plant-based and cultivated meat, play a critical role in Europe’s transition to a more sustainable, healthy and just food system. “They also represent a major commercial opportunity for Europe to implement a truly green recovery from the Covid-19 recession. We warmly welcome the Commission’s wise endorsement of the need for greater R&D investment into alternative proteins.” Today the Commission outlines in its Farm-to-Fork Strategy that animal agriculture is a major contributor to climate change, causing nearly 70% of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. The GFI, along with its partners, has long made the case for making public investments in alternative proteins a priority in the EU, so this has been received as excellent news in terms of progress towards true sustainability. The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy that is currently being negotiated provides the next opportunity for the EU to put its endorsement for alternative proteins into action. “If the EU is serious about shifting to more plant-based food and other alternative proteins, the European Parliament needs to scrap harmful proposals that would ban names like ‘veggie burger’ or ‘plant-based steak’ for alternatives to conventional meat,” said Holst.

The company will open a facility in Falkenberg, Sweden – which is reportedly the first step to “transform the region to be the Silicon Valley of Foodtech in the Nordics.”  The company launched a year ago producing the fungus protein for use as an ingredient in vegan food products and attracted attention at the time for its potential as an alternative to traditional proteins such as soy. Yesterday, Mycorena announced its successful funding round, totaling 1.2 Million EUR to expand its production and finance the sustainable growth of the company. The new investment round attracted investors from FBG Invest (an Industrial Investor Network based in Southern Sweden), Bertebos Foundation (owners of Swedish food companies Berte Qvarn, SIA Glass), Falkenbergs Sparbanks Foundation, investors from GlassWall Syndicate and the company’s existing investors, Bånt AB, Expand Research B.V. and Kale United AB. The company is also funded by EIT Climate-KIC Nordics. The funding will allow the startup to initiate its first small-scale industrial production plant in Falkenberg: “Mycorena is one of the most promising foodtech start-ups in Sweden” states Jan Melkersson, head of Business Development Unit at Falkenberg Municipality. “We are really glad to have Mycorena’s production facility in Falkenberg and it’s our first step towards attracting more start-ups within the foodtech space and transform the region to be the Silicon Valley of Foodtech in the Nordics.” “People are becoming more aware of the importance of having a healthy and sustainable food system, especially at these times when the world is facing a crisis. This awareness is reflecting in the huge boom of the plant-based and non-meat alternative protein segment around the globe. We are really glad to be part of that movement and strongly believe that Promyc is capable of making a disruption within the vegan protein segment,” says Ramkumar Nair, Founder & CEO of Mycorena.

11332,GFI India Partners with AAK Kamani to Advance the Alt Protein Industry in India,https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/gfi-india-partners-with-aak-kamani-to-advance-the-alt-protein-industry-in-india/,2020-05-19,"AAK Kamani, AAK’s majority-owned Indian joint venture, has announced that it has partnered with The Good Food Institute in India to collaborate on research and business promotion aimed at advancing India’s highly promising market for plant-based meat and dairy alternatives.  India holds huge market potential for advancements in alternative protein, having a largely vegetarian population due to the prevalence of its religions practising cruelty-free. India and China make up the two most populous countries in the world and the Chinese market revolution has already begun in earnest; now the same is inevitable in India where the population is already very open to the idea of plantbased alternatives. AAK is headquartered in Sweden, Kamani is its India branch with over 55 years of experience and is a leading manufacturer of speciality vegetable oils and fats. GFI works with scientists, investors and entrepreneurs to make groundbreaking good food a reality. It focuses on clean meat and plant-based alternatives to animal products. Through the partnership, AAK’s Customer Innovation Centre in Mumbai will host AAK KAMANI ACADEMY sessions designed to help businesses and entrepreneurs take advantage of the significant opportunities that exist in India’s plant-based foods category. The collaboration is closely linked to AAK’s global AkoPlanet™ initiative, which provides a platform for plant-based food innovations. With support from the Good Food Institute India, AAK will also provide co-development expertise on how companies can accelerate the formulation of new products, with a particular focus on achieving optimal sensory experience and appealing to local tastes. Varun Deshpande, Managing Director at the Good Food Institute India, commented: “The challenges of climate change, antimicrobial resistance and food insecurity presented by the world’s reliance on animal protein supply chains have been underscored by the COVID-19 public health crisis. Accelerating the development of the plant-based meat, egg and dairy sector is therefore imperative to building a more secure and resilient protein supply. Indian businesses and scientists have immense potential to be at the centre of this development, driving affordability and sensory experiences as well as cultural appeal in transformative plant-based foods – but they need support on their journey. We’re delighted to have pioneering corporate partners like AAK Kamani in our mission for smart protein. Their ingredients and co-development expertise will be integral to building a more healthy, sustainable and just global food system.”    "
11341,ADM and Cargill Speak Out About Dramatic Changes in Food Industry Caused by Consumer Demand,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/adm-and-cargill-speak-out-about-dramatic-changes-in-food-industry-caused-by-consumer-demand/,2020-05-18,"Two giant agriculture businesses have agreed that the shape of the food industry has dramatically changed since the global pandemic began and that the transformation is being led by customer demand. ADM and Cargill are huge global North American agriculture companies largely responsible for upholding the animal agriculture industry.  The foodservice industry is incredibly unstable at present particularly in the US where animal meat is still one of the biggest cogs in the wheel that drives its food system. The logistics of supplying meat have become hugely problematic, as evidenced by a recent full-page notice in the NY Times from the founder Tyson Foods stating that the “food supply chain is breaking,” and “as pork, beef and chicken plants are being forced to close, even for short periods of time, millions of pounds of meat will disappear from the supply chain”. Cargill’s Chief Information Officer Jane Kilmartin stated that “the pandemic has altered consumer behaviour and the customary supply chain practices.” Ms Kilmartin goes on to say: “Coronavirus has led to food giants scrambling to deal with the collapse in the foodservice industry, surging freight rates and all types of logistical challenges. The pandemic has allowed Cargill to identify opportunities both internally and externally.” Worryingly, an article from seafood industry platform undercurrentnews speculates that these companies might be focusing their efforts on aquaculture, as in recent years both companies have bought into the sector, and also recently the White House issued a press release stating that it will “identify and remove unnecessary barriers restricting American fishermen and aquaculture producers.” However, it is also clear that both companies have been recognising the potential of plant-based food. ADM released a report in February stating that 44% of US consumers now identify as flexitarian and that while plant-based burgers led the charge in 2019, ADM predicted new alternative proteins in the form of chicken, sausage, and seafood will take centre stage this year. Cargill announced plans for a plant-based range just before the pandemic erupted globally. As we reported last week, Cargill is to launch a range of plant-based products in China called Plant Ever as of next month, following the success of KFC China’s first plantbased chicken for which it is the supplier. It is evident that owing to the global situation there will be substantial changes carried out by Big Food, but upping the interest in aquaculture is counterproductive; hopefully such corporations continue the pursuit of plant-based foods to enable real sustainable change to our global food system.

The report demonstrates that there is still plenty of mystery in the fledgling industry, as food tech competes to premier and dominate the market from the onset.  The GAO states: “Specific information about the technology being used, eventual commercial production methods, and composition of the final products are not yet known.  It has found that the technology and methods are still in development and said FDA and USDA do not have clarity about what’s going on with the secretive R&D projects.” The report cites the following issues, which we have summarized, as needing further clarity: Many questions of course remain to be answered at this stage and vegconomist will keep you informed of developments. Although it is still debatable as to how vegan cultured meat really is, it clearly has the potential to drastically reduce the devastating impact of traditional animal farming, and remove animals from the food system.

SPINS data showed that plant-based meat retail sales grew to $939 million last year, and this growth significantly accelerated at the beginning of the global pandemic. In early 2020, despite Covid-19, several plant-based meat companies raised significant funds. The GFI cites the following examples of significant investments in Q1 of 2020: Impossible Foods raised another $500 million. Rebellyous raised $6 million. Plantible Foods raised $4.6 million. Chinese plant-based meat company Starfield raised its seed round. The LIVEKINDLY co. was formed with a $200 million investment. “This record-level investment will bolster the industry and support continued growth and innovation for the long term, ensuring that alternative protein companies have the resources to grow and thrive, particularly during times of short-term market volatility.”    "
11385,"Nova Meat: “The Future of Alternative Meat Will Not be Black or White, But a Variety of Hybrids”",https://vegconomist.com/interviews/nova-meat-the-future-of-alternative-meat-will-not-be-black-or-white-but-a-variety-of-hybrids/,2020-05-08,"NovaMeat is the fascinating Spanish startup famous for developing the world’s first 3D printed steak. Last week the company revealed that, as demand for pork continues to rise and meat supply chains continue to break, it has developed a realistic 3D printed pork with the texture and appearance of pork meat.  With no further ado, we introduce Giuseppe Scionti, one of Smithsonian’s “Nine Innovators to Watch”, TEDX speaker, and CEO and founder of Nova Meat. Can you briefly explain 3d printing and how it works – if that is possible in a nutshell?
In our case, using 3D printing is a means to an end, not an end in itself. An advantage of 3D printers is the possibility to precisely control the texture and appearance of our food products. Another advantage of using automatic techniques such as 3D printing is being able to quickly iterate through new prototype versions at a very low price per unit, and personalize the taste and nutritional properties of the products, to meet the needs of the customers. In our case, our microextrusion technology is based on an advanced strategy, borrowed from tissue engineering, which is able to biohack highly-proteic plant-based compositions and process them at the micro- and nanometric levels, to achieve products that mimic a variety of whole muscle cuts. Once scaled at industrial level with faster extruding machines, our microextrusion technology will give plant-based meat manufacturers the tools to create different textures from a wide variety of ingredients, to mimic several types of meat and seafood. In fact, traditional technologies such as low and high-moisture extrusion work well for some applications, but these methods are not ideal for mimicking all types of animal meat and fish. What products have you created through 3d printing so far? How does the taste compare to animal steak and how is that taste achieved from plantbased ingredients?
So far, we have focused on developing the most realistic plant-based steak (which we call “Steak 2.0”), but we are looking forward to releasing new prototypes soon, including plant-based pig meats prototypes (hopefully by fall 2020) and fish prototypes (hopefully by spring 2021). Regarding the taste of our Steak 2.0, we have already tested it with several experts, but we are still optimizing it with the chefs we collaborate with. The taste is achieved by selecting high-quality natural ingredients, generally from the Mediterranean area, and collaborating with the experts and providers that have already successfully worked on some of the most advanced plant-based meat substitutes on the market. You created your first 3d printed foods at the end of 2018 in response to the lack of fibrous texture in plantbased meat. Using tissue engineering and bio-printing, NovaMeat created what it called the first vegan product with the same consistency, appearance, and nutritional properties as animal meat products. Please tell us about the early development and how your work has developed since then.
As many inventions of the past, our technology started as a mistake. Between 2008 and 2018, I have worked on creating a variety of bioengineered animal tissues using natural ingredients, but for biomedical applications. After 10 years working on bioengineered muscles, skin, nerves, cartilages, bones, and some more tissues and organs, and while I was assistant professor in bioengineering in Barcelona, I generated some bioengineered tissues that were surprisingly similar to their animal correspondent tissues. How do you see the future of protein? Will cellbased and even printed food products be a common appearance in the years to come?
At Novameat, we just inaugurated our efforts in the cell-based meat (and fish) sector, thanks to the recent incorporation of our tissue engineering researcher Esther Plans, to commercialize our scaffolding technology to the cultivated meat companies. I personally believe that the future of alternative meat will not be black or white (i.e. with or without animal cells) but a variety of hybrids, where we will have novel products simultaneously exhibiting both the main advantages of plant-based strategies in terms of time and cost-efficiency, and the main advantage of cultivated meat strategies in terms of authenticity. In this decade, I believe that we will not need to replicate a functional or even contractible animal muscle, as its complexity has never been achieved so far. Even the world’s best teams in tissue engineering (e.g. the ones led by Anthony Atala, Robert Langer, or Teruo Okano) have not been able to create and industrially produce complex and functional bioengineered animal organs, including human ones. As for printed food products, in this decade we will see food printers at restaurants and even in some homes, and when it comes to products in retail, there is already a variety of industrial machinery that works similarly to extrusion printers. In your experience, what has been / will be the consumer perception of 3d printed products? Many consumers are seeking healthy lifestyle especially in these times, and want to purchase natural products. What do people say so far about 3d meats?
Food is like religion both in Spain, where Novameat is based, as in Italy, where I come from; according to “Bloomberg Healthiest Country Index “2019, these two countries come first and second in the list respectively, which also leads to a very high reputation given to traditional food. On the other hand, the Mediterranean area is also a very innovative area in terms of gastronomy, with many of the most creative chefs and food innovators located here. All of the above means that Barcelona is a great location to start a food startup that focuses on quality and cutting-edge innovation. Globally, our food printing sparked a great debate in many TV shows including Fox News, and even by politicians: I believe it’s not about whether novel plant-based meats will represent a big share of the protein market, it is just about when. When will your products hit the market?
We are now partnering with some top-chefs, so I am looking forward to seeing our 3D printed plant-based meats at some of the most innovative restaurants before the end of 2020. In parallel, we are focused on scaling our technology at industrial level, and expect to achieve that during 2021. What are the current costs for a printed steak? What is your business model – will you send the printers themselves or will you sell the final products?
Although there is a lot of interest in our technology at small scale with the 3D printers, our business model is focused on commercializing our technologies at industrial scale with bigger machines. Specifically, we are going to provide plant-based meat manufacturers the tools to create different textures from a variety of ingredients, to mimic several types of meat and seafood. Anything else of interest which you would like to tell our readers at this time?
We aim to give a contribution in protecting our planet, animal welfare, and our health, and hopefully be remembered by the future generations for creating a new generation of more sustainable and healthier plant-based meats.    "
11404,New Crop Capital Leads Convertible Note Round in Heura – the Fastest Growing Vegan Meat Startup in Europe,https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/new-crop-capital-leads-convertible-note-round-in-heura-the-fastest-growing-vegan-meat-startup-in-europe/,2020-05-05,"Breaking news: New Crop Capital has invested in Foods for Tomorrow, producer of plantbased chicken Heura as well as other products including the Heura Burger. The Barcelona startup recently announced to vegconomist that it is the fastest-growing European startup in the plant-based meat industry with a 450% growth in the last year. The company also informs us that prolific vegan investor Michiel van Deursen, Founder at Capital V, has also participated in the round. Capital V’s portfolio includes several brands often reported about here at vegconomist, including The Vegetarian Butcher, Pinatex, Veganz, Better Nature, and Allplants. Click here to watch an interview between Michiel and our US correspondent Elysabeth Alfano in her Plantbased Business Hour. New Crop Capital has invested in over 40 alternative protein ventures to date, including Beyond Meat, with the goal of transforming the trillion-dollar global market of industrial animal agriculture. This is a mission shared by Heura, which aims to combat the excessive increase in chicken consumption with the production of its plant-based chicken meat which is both realistic and sustainable. “We are so proud to have a startup like Heura in our portfolio and accompany them in their mission. Consumers are asking for innovation and choice, and plant-based options are on the menu. With determined and focused teams like Heura, this challenge is being met” explains Chris Kerr, Chief Investment Officer, New Crop Capital. “On top of mission alignment, their commitment to creating the best product experience, with high focus on the nutritional facts inherent in their Mediterranean heritage, will be key to adding value to the plant-based protein industry” adds Kerr. Marc Coloma, CEO and co-founder of Heura, which also received funding from the Spanish government this January, told us why he believes his startup and NCC are a good match and a logical partnership: “Our mission and values are the core of our business and New Crop Capital, as us, are here for the purpose. Savvy on the plant-based space with high knowledge on the food industry makes them key from a strategic point of view topped by being entrepreneurs boosting entrepreneurs. We certainly couldn’t find a better match to help us boost our growth.”       "
11406,"Consortium of Ten Plant-Based Giants Announce Go-Ahead for ‘Plenitude’, World’s First Large Scale Mycoprotein Facility",https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/consortium-of-ten-plant-based-giants-announce-go-ahead-for-plenitude-worlds-first-large-scale-mycoprotein-facility/,2020-05-04,"Plenitude is a project launched by a consortium of ten partners spanning biotech, protein expertise, sustainability, and three key players in food – Mosa Meat, Vivera, and ABP. The group has announced the go-ahead for the building of a first-of-its-kind, large-scale mycoprotein facility, following its securing last year of €17m in funding.  The focus of the five-year project is on “finding, developing, and marketing mycoprotein” into the categories of food markets (meat, meat-free, dairy-free, and many other applications), pet food, bio-plastics, and cultured meat. According to a study on which we reported in October, the worldwide market for mycoprotein products was valued at around US$200 million in 2018 and was projected to see a growth rate of over 12% up to 2027. In February, a new scientific paper, the most comprehensive paper for introducing mycroprotein as a meat substitute, showed that producing mycoproteins does not create pollutants or emissions, generates 10 times less greenhouse gas emissions compared to beef, four times less compared to chicken, uses up 20 times less water, and 23 times less land than livestock farming. The ten partners bring together key specialisms and expertise, these include primary processing and industrial operations (Alcogroup SA), biotechnology (3F BIO Limited), product development and applications (International Flavors & Fragrances I.F.F. B.V), primary research and protein expertise (Wageningen University) specialist consultants covering marketing and sustainability (Bridge2Food, Life Cycle Engineering Srl), and three end-users covering food categories (Mosa Meat, Vivera, ABP) as well as one end-user covering bio-plastics (Lactips). The project addresses the protein challenge by integrating two established processes into a flagship, large-scale, first-of-its-kind, biorefinery producing bioethanol and sustainable food protein. The process takes a proportion of the sustainable cereal crops that feed the biorefinery to create a feedstock for the fermentation process that produces ABUNDA® mycoprotein. With an initial output capacity of 16k tonnes per annum, this flagship project will increase the availability of sustainable, high-quality food protein. The collaboration between the biorefinery operator, food producers and technology providers will create new cross-sector interconnections, new bio-based value chains, and new bio-based ‘consumer’ products. Commenting on the announcement, Dean Holroyd, Group Technical and Sustainability Director, ABP, said: “We operate the highest standards in sustainability across our business and we are keen to be actively involved in addressing the challenges of feeding a rapidly growing population and sustainably as possible.”    "

11419,"IntegriCulture Japan: “I Want to Realize Cultured Meat, a Staple of Science Fiction”",https://vegconomist.com/interviews/integriculture-japan-i-want-to-realize-cultured-meat-a-staple-of-science-fiction/,2020-04-30," The founder of IntegriCulture says that his reason for starting the research and development of cultured meat is “because it is a staple of Science Fiction”. After working at Tohoku University and Toshiba Research and Development Center, Mr Hanyu founded IntegriCulture Co., Ltd. in 2015, and launched Japan’s first artificially-cultured meat project, the Shojinmeat Project. We asked Mr. Hanyu, the unique CEO, about his entrepreneurial story and future challenges. Please tell readers about your current efforts
There are three major frameworks. The first one is “Shojinmeat Project“. This is a kind of club consisting mainly of high school students and young adults, and there is no definition of membership, so anyone can participate. In order to lower the technical hurdles, we have released information that allows elementary school students to challenge cell culture (eg, let’s make a cell culture device for 2000 yen etc.). The second is an industry-academia-government collaboration called the Japan Cellular Agriculture Association (日本細胞農業協会). We plan to carry out dissemination activities on a daily basis by holding research societies, seminars, and workshops on cellular agriculture. And the third one is our company IntegriCulture. The purpose is to commercialize culture technology. It is a spin-out company derived from the Shojinmeat Project. Speaking of Cultured meat; it is very rare in Japan – what made you start your business?
I’ve always loved science fiction since I was a kid. When I was a student, I used to create future cities with games. Six years ago, I chose cultured meat when I was looking for the next project on the axis of “what I can do now?” In February 2014, I prepared a pitch deck and started gathering partners. After that it connected current efforts such as Shojinmeat Project and IntegriCulture. Please tell us more about your company’s features
By utilizing our in-house technology, called the CulNet System, we are tackling cost reduction, which is one of the issues of cultured meat. A medium for culturing cells requires a basal medium and growth hormone, but growth hormone is the main reason for raising the cost (there is also a component of 1 g 8.1 billion yen). The trouble is that without growth hormones, cells will not grow. However, when you think carefully, the cells of humans and animals are increasing every day. This is because various organs make hormones. In CulNet System, the growth hormone that is purchased from the outside with conventional cultured meat, that is, collected from animals, is made inside the machine. “CulNet System” is being developed so that it can be used by various people. First of all, I would like to use it for food manufacturers, etc., gradually aiming for a level that can be used at butchers in the town and finally at home. Please tell us about your future challenges
First, we are developing products with the theme of anti-aging in the cosmetics field by April 2021. After that, we are promoting test sales of cultured foie gras by the end of 2021. This is actually planned to be developed at a certain restaurant. If you inject growth hormones from the outside, you will get rejected from the public health center, but our CulNet System does not need to do so, so preparation is proceeding without difficulty. This foie gras will go on the market in 2023 (however, a mixture of cultured meat and plant meat is assumed at the beginning). We will also focus on the development of steaks by 2025. Do you think that cultured meat will become popular in Japan?
I think that dissemination activities will be vital. When the media now reports on cultured meat, the scenery of the laboratory will inevitably come to the front. At the stage of commercialization, I think that it will be manufactured in a place like a beer factory rather than a laboratory. By using the media to clearly convey who and how they make it, we would like to work on making the cultured meat familiar. Please give a message to readers
The CulNet System is a system that allows you to make growth hormones, which are generally bought from outside, inside a machine. This system has been developed so that it can be used by various people, and we are promoting joint development in collaboration with a major food manufacturer in Japan. We would be grateful if any of the companies who think they would like to develop jointly using CulNet System would contact us. Those who want to get involved in the development of the CulNet System itself are also welcome. Apart from business, you can freely participate in Shojinmeat Project as an individual, so please see that as well.    "
11428,What Needs to Happen to Convert Mass Meat Lovers to Alt-Meat?,https://vegconomist.com/business-insiders/what-needs-to-happen-to-convert-mass-meat-lovers-to-alt-meat/,2020-04-29,"Evolving plant-based meat to bridge the gap for meat lovers: with environmental concerns, global supply chain crises and food security risks taking centre stage worldwide – the pressure is on to create a sustainable alternative to meat that is enjoyed by all. However, convincing the bulk of the population – big meat eaters – to make any meaningful lifestyle shift seems like an insurmountable challenge.  Eshchar Ben-Shitrit, CEO and founder of Redefine Meat, which is developing 3D printed meat, explores the Alt-Meat movement and the new emerging technologies that will meet this challenge. How do we make Alt-Meat as enjoyable as meat, to create a new industry as big and diverse as animal meat? A report by the IPCC (A UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) published in August 2019 highlights the adoption of a more plant-based diet as one of the major ways to actively combat climate change.[1] This realization, along with growing societal interest in animal welfare and healthier eating habits, has led to a huge surge in vegetarians, vegans and, more recently, flexitarians over the past decade. While the popularity of alternative meat diets has grown, the reality is that these people form a small minority globally. The mass habitual consumption of meat still occurs on a daily basis – including red meat. Making a dietary shift is certainly not always easy, especially given that for many eating habits are engrained in them since childhood. Meat isn’t just food; the act of eating meat is embedded in our culture, history, memories, and passions. As a result, the holy grail of the alternative meat movement is making that transition for consumers as seamless as possible – bridging the gap between the accustomed taste, texture ,and experience of meat and the current experience when consuming plant-based meat. In recent years, alternative meat products have evolved to rectify this imbalance, which is essential to driving a change in the eating habits of the masses, whether that’s reducing weekly meat consumption or cutting it out entirely. So why exactly is there still hesitancy from meat-lovers to adopt alternative meats as a supplement to actual meat? And importantly, how does the “Alt-Meat” industry change pre-existing perceptions of its product being a considerable downgrade from the real thing? After all, the prize is a $1.5 Trillion meat industry, so what needs to happen to make Alt-Meat a main player and not just niche? First introduced into the mainstream in 1985 by the likes of Quorn and Tivall, Alt-Meat is not a recent phenomenon. Their products were created to feed the growing population of vegetarians with the primary objective to deliver a tasty product that was high in protein. It was only in 2012 that Beyond Meat released a chicken-like substitute to target consumers previously missed by Alt-Meat companies – meat-lovers. This began a movement to create a convincing meat substitute, in both taste and texture. Following close behind, Impossible Foods arrived in the consumer market in 2016, with a burger that took further steps to understand the carnivorous consumer and recreate the composition of meat – cracking an integral missing part of the flavor profile of meat. For the first time in history, Alt-Meat started to feel really like actual meat. These companies have all made waves in the food industry since their release, with products not only featuring in supermarkets across the globe, but also within the menus of chain restaurants such as Burger King, Subway and Dunkin Donuts. Despite the tremendous revolution of recent years, the nascent industry has huge gaps compared to the incumbent one. Several decent alternatives to chicken and hamburger products exist, but step into any meat aisle in your average supermarket and get a real picture. There will no doubt be a wide selection of meats available – beef, pork, and chicken to name a few – with a vast array of products for each whether it be minced, steaks, roasts, stews, and more – all at a range of price points. Alt-Meat has probably a hundredth of that. And, even more importantly, many still do not consider even the best Alt-Meat products a good alternative to below-average minced meat. In order to bridge this gap, the technologies, production methods and supply chain of alt-meat need to evolve to directly address the real and complete needs of stakeholders across the value chain. But what exactly needs to happen to see this in our lifetime? Firstly, the importance of working alongside the existing meat industry, instead of against them, is vital. After all, who knows more about meat than the ones who work with it on a daily basis. Butchers large and small know their customers, in some cases for many generations. They know chefs and the habit of families cooking meat 5 times a week. They know the farmers, the breed, the feed and the ageing process. Therefore, it’s essential that all this knowledge is fed into the Alt-Meat development process in order to create better products. Saying “it’s meat made from plants” doesn’t answer the real questions – what is meat and what is it that makes meat, meat? As such, key to unlocking the true potential of Alt-Meat is understanding the composition of meat – not as just a biological artifact, but why and what exactly it is that people love about it. Replicating the color and taste is not enough. Alt-Meat products that are going to convert your longstanding meat lover need to create the ‘complete experience’ comprising a complex matrix of senses and attributes – taste, texture, visual appearance, cooking behaviour and smell to name a few. Just as a pool player doesn’t need to know physics to act upon a very complex equation to hit an 8-ball in the pocket, no-one is aware of the thousands of processes taking place when we bite through a juicy piece of meat – but our brain does. At the end of the day, for mass conversion to take place consumers need to actively incorporate Alt-Meat-meat products in their lifestyle and habits as opposed to just enjoying the taste as a novelty. Tackling the challenge at a production process level is also essential to driving meaningful change. Today, many food companies approach development at the product or ingredient level, altering recipes to bring out newly enhanced products such as the next yogurt or chocolate bar. But if 100 companies each work on one product, if they all succeed you will only have 100 products. On the flipside, if you have ten companies working on new technologies or processes that can generate entirely new products, you can create thousands of products. If we apply this directly to the Alt-Meat industry, today most companies are developing better burgers or improved chicken nuggets at the product-level. However, if we want to seriously change the make-up of your traditional supermarket meat aisle – which not only comprises many meats like beef, pork, chicken and lamb, but also various cuts, different ageing, cooking styles etc. – then new technologies and production processes need to emerge to significantly expand the plant-based meat product line. Strategically, this is where we are placing our emphasis, but also leveraging innovative technologies to overcome the limitations of current Alt-Meat production techniques in order to significantly enhance the Alt-Meat experience for consumers. For example, Redefine Meat’s new 3D printing process enables the precise composition of meat layer by layer to bring every fiber of real meat to fruition in a way that conventional Alt-Meat processes cannot. This production method opens up a vast array of possibilities, offering new players across the food supply chain the ability to accurately control the characteristics of meat they require, such as the specific marbling of Wagyu beef from Japan or the texture of grass-fed Australian Angus prime beef. The emergence of new technologies capable of creating an Alt-Meat tasting experience that resembles the animal meat we are accustomed to will be vital to converting mass meat lovers to plant-based alternatives. Adopting digital production methods, such as 3D printing, also open the door to advanced AI & machine learning technologies that can further optimize the Alt-Meat experience for consumers. With the ability to learn consumer habits, likes, dislikes and more, these learnings can be fed through into development and refinement of meat production – further enhancing the product to consumer requirements. This can drive a more modern ‘digitalized’ supply chain built to adopt innovation at a faster pace, delivering new alt-meat products faster based on consumer needs – so much so that you can customize meat offerings to different geographies. While on the surface it may seem that we’re still some way off from bridging the existing chasm for meat lovers, the reality is that companies such as ours are making rapid developments in the aforementioned areas. In fact, in the near future novel Alt-Meat production techniques, that for the first time have been built upon ‘understanding what makes meat, meat’, are set to come to market – heralding a new era of Alt-Meat that has the potential to drive real long term change amongst meat lovers. Such a shift away from a heavily animal-based diet would have huge benefits both for the consumer and the food industry. With the ability to produce meat on-demand at or close to the point of sale, 3D printing reinvents the traditional supply chain and its centralized production models. Instead of depending on suppliers to deliver meat from the original source around the globe, 3D printing opens up a world of on-demand production at the site you need it, when you need it, in the exact quantity you need. Not only does this further increase sustainability in production by hugely reducing the pollution associated with logistics and waste, 3D printing meat can also play a major role in overcoming shortages derived from disrupted supply chains. You only have to look at what we’re facing right now with the Coronavirus, where cross-border logistics are being hugely impacted, or at geo-political issues such as Brexit or the US-China trade war that can directly impact the supply chain. With on-demand production enabled directly at the site that needs product, these supply chain bottlenecks can be overcome. Consumers will enjoy more optionality regarding the source of meat they consume – animal-based, plant-based, fungi-based and in the future products coming from cultured meat. This will enable conscious carnivores to actively make changes to reduce their food environmental impact – just like they do with their transportation habits. More affordable protein sources will become a viable option, allowing the Alt-Meat industry economies of scale it lacks today. We will have fewer hormones, cholesterol and animal-related pathogens in our food system, and this will have an overwhelmingly positive impact on our lives.

Now the food tech industry is keen to know how consumers will accept engineered meat products. UM researchers conducted this study with 193 Dutch meat-eaters to test perceptions amongst Europeans.  Since the first cultured meat products are due to become available in high-end restaurants in the near future and to be stocked in supermarkets by 2030, foodtech continues to research into the concept of public perceptions thereof. A recent study comparing acceptance of cultured protein found consumers in China and India to lean far more positively than those in the USA, and now this new study examines acceptance amongst Europeans. The study was published on the 16th April 2020 in the scientific journal PLOSONE. Divided by gender and into three age groups, participants were further split into groups who commented on: societal benefits (environment, animal welfare); personal benefits (process, info on nutrition and safety); and meat quality and taste (no specific benefits of cultured meat given). The study surveyed acceptance prior to and after the tastings whereby participants did not know which meat was cultured. The results showed that the participants rated the flavour of the ‘cultured’ hamburger as better than that of the ‘ordinary’ one. 58 percent of the respondents said they would be prepared to pay a premium for cultured meat at an average of 37 percent on top of the price of ordinary meat. Professor Mark Post commented: “This study confirms that cultured meat is acceptable to consumers if sufficient information is provided and the benefits are clear. This has also led to increased acceptance in recent years. The study also shows that consumers will eat cultured meat if they are served it.” UM-researcher Nathalie Rolland further added: “I was surprised by the results of the study and the participants’ acceptance level. This study shows the importance of reliable and accessible information for consumers. Interestingly, all participants were willing to eat a piece of meat they believed to be cultured. That is a step further than just verbally accepting.”    "

Plant-based proteins, synthetic biology, cultured meat, and sustainability in the food system are the main areas of interest for Blue Horizon Ventures. We were extremely interested to receive Michael’s unique insight into the world of vegan business investment. What is the focus of Blue Horizon Ventures?
Blue Horizon Ventures is a food technology-focused venture capital fund founded in 2018 and managed by the three partners: Roger Lienhard, Michael Kleindl and Dr. Regina Hecker. The fund aims to support the movement towards a more sustainable food system through innovation, technology and entrepreneurship. The underlying mission of the fund is to promote a positive global impact on the environment, human health and animal welfare. Does Blue Horizon Ventures invest only in plant-based or also in cultured products?
Our investments thesis builds on the strong belief that we as society will eat differently in the (very) near future. We do currently focus on four main areas where we have done and will be doing investments. This includes: 1. Alternative proteins (B2B and B2C) 2. Cultivated Food 3. Synthetic Biology and 4. General ideas that promote sustainability in the food system, mainly in the areas of Packaging and Food Waste. In the future we might want to look as well at the agro tech space. What is the connection to Blue Horizon Corporation?
Blue Horizon Corporation is the private investment vehicle of Roger Lienhard, a Swiss serial entrepreneur and investor. Roger via his company Blue Horizon Corporation is a shareholder of the General Partner, one of many investors in the fund. His private investments are completely independent of any work and investments in the fund. What does the current portfolio look like and how much have you already invested in companies?
The current portfolio includes The Live Kindly Co., Veestro, Alpha Foods, Love Raw, Algama, TIPA, Human Food, and Clara Foods. So far we have invested circa. EUR 30m. We do expect to add another 5 – 6 investments in the next quarter which will take the total amount of invested capital to EUR ca. 50 – 60M. So we continue to be very active. We believe the current COVID crisis is demonstrating the origins of the large problems we have in the current food system and this is now even further accelerating the way to a more sustainable food system. The crisis is creating opportunities for us. What new investments will Blue Horizon Ventures realize this year?
For obvious reasons I cannot yet disclose exactly which investments we will be carrying out. But I can say that there will be deals in Germany, Spain, the US and Mexico in very well diversified sectors and business models. Besides these 5 -6 scheduled investments for the second quarter (see above), which will bring the total portfolio number of companies to circa 13 – 14 I would estimate that we will add an additional 4 – 5 until the end of the year 2020. A fair estimate would be that by then we have invested circa EUR 70 – 80M. This will clearly put us in the top range of global investors in the Food Tech and Sustainability landscape in terms of the number of investments but as well in terms of capital deployed. Who invests in Blue Horizon Ventures?
We do count on the support from a variety of large family offices, institutional investors funds and asset managers as well as some corporates from the food industry. What conditions do companies have to meet in order to be considered for investment?
They have to fit into our investment thesis, so ideally be part of one of the four main areas we have identified:  1. Alternative proteins (B2B and B2C) 2. Cultivated Food 3. Synthetic Biology and 4. General ideas that promote sustainability in the food system, mainly in the areas of Packaging and Food Waste. Most importantly we really want to see strong, innovative, hungry and ambitious entrepreneurs whom we can back with capital and help to fulfill their dreams. Other than that we can be very flexible on a variety of criteria. While we have a preference for Series A and B we are stage agnostic, which means we can do a seed investment as well as participate in a Pre-IPO round. We like Europe a lot but operate on a global scale, so we can look at investments coming from all regions around the world. We target shareholding between 10 – 30 % over the lifetime of the company and love to provide value add as much as we can given the entrepreneurial DNA we have ourselves and our experience as entrepreneurs and investors. Tickets in special circumstances can start as low as EUR 300 – 400K and can go up to ca. EUR 20 – 25M. Always over the lifespan of the company.  What advice are you giving your portfolio companies given the current macro conditions?
The first piece of advice is to remain “cash-rich” and dial back unnecessary expenses as raising capital in this environment may become more difficult or with terms less friendly to those that have been offered in recent months or years. This also provides an opportunity to scrutinise every cost on the income statement and filter out the important and optional ones. Exploring alternative financing options like grants or loans is also a good idea in this environment.  Second, remain aligned with the long term vision, but also build different scenarios to account for the reality that things are likely to get worse before getting better. This requires a delicate balance of vision, realism and discipline, but it’s crucial for long term viability. We are committed to helping portfolio companies as they work through these options and providing a sounding board for challenges they may face. What added value does BHV bring to startups, next to financial support?
One of Blue Horizon Ventures’ strengths is its dynamic and mission-driven team including individuals from different cultural as well as professional backgrounds. Together with a strong international network, across both industry and academia, we are able to evaluate and support a company along its entire value chain and at different growth stages. Depending on the nature and phase of a business this can range from general corporate governance and warm introductions (e.g. to retail or other potential customers) to the development of scale-up models, marketing action plans and IP strategies. The partners at BHV also have the experience to facilitate and support different exit scenarios, including IPOs. To identify and understand a company’s needs early-on we like to stay in close contact with all our entrepreneurs…regular catch-up calls and site visits are part of it but we also enjoy talking and laughing over a drink.

11479,The University of Copenhagen Reveals the Broad Bean to be Worthy Opponent to Controversial Soy,https://vegconomist.com/science/the-university-of-copenhagen-reveals-the-broad-bean-to-be-worthy-opponent-to-controversial-soy/,2020-04-20,"The University of Copenhagen has found a method for making protein powder from broad (also known as fava) beans. Researchers tested different crops in relation to which had the greatest potential as a protein powder in foods and could be grown locally. Broad beans were found to surpass lentils, amaranth, buckwheat and quinoa.  The Danes are increasingly seeking plant-based protein and at the same time the soy bean continues to cause controversy amongst the new generation of vegans. According to the WWF, soy is the second biggest contributor to deforestation, after animal farming. Soy can be also highly genetically modified so that it can withstand herbicides like Roundup. Using a method called ‘wet fractionation’, the researchers succeeded in concentrating the protein from broad beans and removing the substances that inhibit the digestion of the proteins. This ensures better absorption of the nutrition from the bean protein as we eat it. Iben Lykke Petersen explained: “One thing is the content and nutritional quality of protein. Something else is the taste! But here too the broad bean can compete with soy and other alternative protein sources. When the broad bean is treated in the right way, the proteins retain the naturally bright colour, as well as a neutral taste and good texture. The producers in the market prefer to have a product that is tasteless, has a neutral colour and a solid texture.”    "
11489,The Good Food Institute: “Completely Committed to Accelerating Vital Changes to Our Global Food System”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/the-good-food-institute-completely-committed-to-accelerating-vital-changes-to-our-global-food-system/,2020-04-16,"The Good Food Institute is a global nonprofit building a more sustainable, healthy, and just food system. Its aim is to bring closer a future where plantbased foods and slaughter-free ‘cultured’ meat are a normal part of life. Regular readers will be familiar with the crucial and compelling work of the GFI which we cover on a regular basis .  The GFI consists of scientists, entrepreneurs, lawyers, and policy experts working to harness the power of food innovation and markets to accelerate the transition of the world’s food system to plant-based and cellular agriculture. We were delighted to speak with Sanah Baig, Chief of Staff at the Good Food Institute. Please can you explain the purpose of the GFI to our readers?
We work across three key programmatic areas: corporate engagement, science & technology, and policy. Our Corporate Engagement Team builds collaborative relationships with the largest food processing companies, chain restaurants, and grocery stores to maximize the availability, quality, quantity, and promotion of plant-based and cultivated meat. Our Science and Technology Team are the leading experts on the cutting-edge science of alternative proteins. They analyze the state of the industry, identify top research opportunities, engage scientists and engineers from academia and industry, and mobilize funding to accelerate the industry. Along with Corporate Engagement, they also bring people together to form new companies and connect these new companies to expertise and funding. Our Policy Team works closely with legislators and regulators to ensure a clear and efficient path to market for cultivated meat. They also work on the federal and state levels to ensure that plant-based meat can compete on a level playing field. Finally, they work to secure R&D funding for alternative proteins from governments and funding institutions. GFI does all of the above not only in the United States, but also through our five affiliates in Asia-Pacific, Brazil, Europe, India, Israel, and in collaboration with partners in a growing number of countries around the world. We are trying to accelerate the delivery of sustainable protein globally as quickly as possible. What were the GFI’s greatest achievements in 2019 – what are you most proud of?
Our team accomplished so much in 2019 that it’s hard to pick just a few achievements. Our SciTech team provided $3 million in grants for open-access research on alternative proteins. Our Corporate Engagement team published State of the Industry reports on plant-based and cultivated meat, providing the first in-depth analyses of the investment landscapes in these fields. Our Policy team successfully lobbied Congress to affirm support for funding for alternative proteins research in the 2020 agricultural appropriations report.  Internationally, GFI India secured a partnership with the Indian government to create the Centre for Cellular Agriculture for cultivated meat research, and GFI Brazil provided support to the country’s largest egg producer to launch a plant-based egg product. GFI Europe was officially incorporated in Belgium and began operating across the continent. GFI APAC published the first China Plant-based Industry report, while GFI Israel worked with two leading universities to add alternative protein courses to their 2020 curricula.  All of these achievements and more are detailed in our 2019 Year in Review. Where do you already have subsidiaries?
GFI has always recognized the importance of expanding our work beyond the United States. Meat consumption is rising worldwide, especially in emerging economies, where population growth and per capita income are both steadily increasing. Our first affiliate team was established in Brazil just over three years ago, and since then we have expanded to India, Asia Pacific, Europe, and Israel.  Can you give us an idea of the scale of the GFI – how many employees in how many countries?
We have 65 employees in the United States and about 30 employees across our affiliate teams.  What exactly is cultivated meat and how is it produced?
We can grow meat directly from cells. Compared to conventional meat production, this alternative requires a fraction of the land and water and emits a fraction of the greenhouse gases. This is just a much better way of producing meat for our environment. Beginning with a small sample of animal cells, we can directly grow the cells into the same meat, poultry, and fish products we enjoy eating today. In conventional animal farming, cell growth occurs in an animal. But we can grow these cells in what is known as a cultivator. The cultivator facilitates the same biological process that happens inside an animal by providing warmth and the basic elements needed to build muscle: water, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Cultivating meat is similar to the way we help plant cuttings to take root in a greenhouse, which provides warmth, fertile soil, water, and nutrients.  The result is an abundance of pure meat, identical to conventional meat at the cellular level. It looks, tastes, and cooks the same. Compared to conventional meat production, meat cultivation requires only a fraction of the natural resources, decreasing the rate of methane emissions, deforestation, antibiotic resistance, biodiversity loss, and foodborne illnesses. Because this new method of production requires fewer resources, it should ultimately be possible to cultivate meat at a lower cost. Innovators around the world are working to bring this new way of producing beef, poultry, pork, fish, and seafood to market at a competitive price point. When will cultivated meat be on the shelves? Why do we need it?
The current consensus is that cultivated meat may be available in very limited terms in high-end restaurants (e.g. a pasta dish with cultivated meatballs) within a year or two, but that it will be at least five more years beyond that before cultivated meat/seafood is anywhere near widely available to the average consumer. We need cultivated meat for a number of reasons. Climate change is quickly approaching a point-of-no-return, and land and marine ecosystems are degrading at an alarming rate. Meanwhile, the human population is exploding and per capita income is increasing, which is driving the global demand for meat and exacerbating these issues. Unabated, meat production and consumption will increase by another 50% or more by 2050, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization.  Industrial animal agriculture is responsible for at least 14% of greenhouse gas emissions— more than the entire transportation sector combined (i.e., the exhaust of every plane, train, and automobile). Chatham House – the most widely cited think tank in Europe – declared that governments will be unsuccessful in meeting their Paris Accord goal of holding climate change to less than 2 degrees Celsius by 2050 unless their populations consume less meat.  However, the vast majority of people are not likely to make food choices based on environmental concerns. We’ve known for 50 years that conventional meat production is inefficient and polluting, and yet meat consumption continues to increase, especially in developing economies. We are unlikely to change that, but we can change the nature of the meat that people eat. How is the GFI’s work financed?
GFI is completely financed by philanthropy, both from foundations and from individual donors. We have an amazing community of donors that are very invested in our work and wholeheartedly support our mission and theory of change. How will coronavirus impact the world of plant-based industry?
While it’s still a bit early to say, there are several possibilities we think could happen. For example,  product demand could outpace supply, which would require a significant ramp-up of production. We could continue to see significant declines in foodservice sales, which could trigger  a meaningful shift in distribution channels towards retail and direct to consumer (DTC). And of course, there are a host of possible ingredient sourcing and manufacturing challenges that could impact production.  In the near-term, manufacturers will need to shift volume from foodservice to retail channels. Foodservice outlets have provided a great channel to introduce consumers to plant-based meat – including the many new consumers introduced to plant-based meat through the popular restaurant chains that launched new options in the past year. Those consumers will now be looking to purchase the same plant-based meat products at the grocery store. Retailers will be looking to manufacturers who can provide a steady supply of high-velocity plant-based proteins.  Many retailers and restaurants have slowed down or paused new product launches, so many existing and planned tests of plant-based items are now on hold, which will depress short-term sales growth for many plant-based companies. This is likely to impact many emerging categories and newer, smaller brands throughout the store, whether plant-based or not.  Some previously overlooked plant-based product attributes are coming in handy during the crisis, such as shelf-stable plant-based milks. While cow milk is usually sold fresh and perishable, many plant-based milks can be stored at ambient temperatures and last longer, which consumers are seeing as an asset as everyone stocks up and tries to avoid frequent grocery store trips. The recent history of plant-based meat showed stronger growth in refrigerated vs. frozen plant-based meat, but with consumers now more interested in longer shelf life, the frozen category might gain a growth boost that could build long-term loyalty.  What is your biggest focus in 2020 and in the current climate?
Our focus in 2020 is staying the course. We have been on an incredible trajectory the last few years and are as committed to our mission as ever. While we are no doubt experiencing changes to our work, our aim has not shifted. Time that we would have spent on travel and attending conferences is now devoted to reflecting, strategizing, and strengthening our internal systems. We are also very focused on keeping morale up and providing our employees with the support that they need during this time, be it additional mental health resources or even greater flexibility in taking time off to take care of family. Luckily, most of our employees were already working remotely, so we have been able to continue our work fairly seamlessly. We are interfacing with companies, universities, scientists, and investors as much as ever, and are finding more ways to reach our audiences virtually. GFI Israel, for example, recently hosted a webinar series that had over 600 attendees, and our University Innovation Specialists are helping students figure out how to advance alternative proteins while their school experience has been moved online.  Our team remains completely committed to accelerating vital changes to our global food system, and we believe that whatever the changed world on the other side of this pandemic may hold, a more healthy, just, and sustainable food system will need to be a part of it.  What is your mission for the next years?
Over the next few years, we would like to move the plant-based meat field to maturity and the cultivated meat field from infancy into adolescence. This will involve helping plant-based meat become normalized in the same way that plant-based milk is, and preparing consumers for cultivated meat.  We would like to see alternative protein become its own recognized field. Within that field, GFI hopes to continue serving as the glue for all alternative protein players and the destination for all things alternative proteins. We are aiming to be a truly global organization, powered by philanthropy, and sustainable in all of our practices.     "
11519,Food Scientists Awarded GFI Grant to Make Plant Protein Look and Feel More Like Whole Meat,https://vegconomist.com/society/food-scientists-awarded-gfi-grant-to-make-plant-protein-look-and-feel-more-like-whole-meat/,2020-04-09,"Food scientists from the University of Massachusetts have received a grant from the Good Food Institute to develop alternatives to whole chicken, pork and beef using plant proteins. The team is led by Professor of Food Science David Julian McClements, well-known for his cutting-edge work in food design and nanotechnology.  As we reported at the end of March, the GFI’s competitive research grant program offered grantsto the sum of $4 million to support 21 research teams aiming to improve the sensory qualities, cost and profitability of alternative proteins. The team of scientists at University of Massachusetts will receive $200,000 over two years. Professor McClements’ team, specialising in taste physiology and sensory science, gut health, food processing and plant-based meat product development, includes: Amanda Kinchla, extension associate professor; Jiakai Lu, assistant professor; Alissa Nolden, assistant professor; David Sela, associate professor; and Hang Xiao, professor and Clydesdale Scholar. “This grant will allow us to explore the use of applied nanotechnology and structural design to create molecular architectures from plant proteins that resemble those in meat,” McClements states. “In particular, we aim to simulate the properties of whole chicken, pork or beef – rather than burgers, sausages or nuggets that exist already.” The team will work towards developing fiber-like structures from plant proteins to improve the texture of plant-based meat. “This would advance our technological ability to create meat-like fibers without the process of extrusion,” says McClements in the university’s press release.

11526,Fry’s Family Food: “We Can See From Our Own Sales Figures & the Growth of Our Company That the Industry is Changing at a Rapid Pace”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/frys-family-food-we-can-see-from-our-own-sales-figures-the-growth-of-our-company-that-the-industry-is-changing-at-a-rapid-pace/,2020-04-07,"Originally operating in South Africa and Australia, the plantbased range from Fry’s Family Foods is also now available in the UK and US where they continue to see growth in sales. Having recently been acquired by the LIVEKINDLY co, we caught up with Tammy Fry to see how things have changed in Fry’s since we last spoke in 2018.  What is your current vegan portfolio – what is new since we last spoke with you in Sept 2018?
We have over 60 different products which is quite unique in the plant-based meat space. It’s been a huge selling point with retails and foodservice outlets. Unlike most of the other companies in the retail plant-based space who have a handful of products, our range runs the gamut from burgers and nuggets to “seafood” and sausages, to pizza, roasts, snacks, pies and pastries. Our two more exciting new products are the pizzas, which are hand-made in Italy, and the Big Fry Burger. In the UK we recently launched a chilled range of to-go meals in Tesco which have been a big hit so far. What are the most significant changes you have seen take place since that time, in terms of the plant-based industry?
We can see from our own sales figures and the growth of our company that the industry is changing at a rapid pace. We’ve grown nearly 30-40% year on year and more recently, with how consumers’ buying habits have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen that same 30-40% growth in March alone because of how consumers are taking advantage of the wealth of plant-based options. We are also finding that, especially with the foodservice industry, there is more of an openness to and excitement about plant-based meats, whereas in the past, and we’ve been in the game for 30 years, there was a hesitancy about plant-based meats. Since we last spoke to you, Fry’s has expanded to the US – do you have plans for further expansion?
The US is the only market in which Fry’s has expanded since we last spoke in late 2018 but more markets will be opening up in the near future for us. How much has Fry’s grown in terms of your workforce and presence?
Our workforce has not expanded that much although we have increased capacity and have mechanized part of our production process. We do outsource some of the sales and marketing functions, although we have added people to our team, they might not be direct Fry’s employees. In terms of presence, the entire supermarket industry has watched as plant-based sales have grown at a far greater pace than some of the other food categories and accordingly retailers have opened up freezer and chiller space for vegan products like Fry’s. It’s also now becoming commonplace to see plant-based meats within the meat section. So, in effect it’s been a perfect storm of increased availability of plant-based products and a spike in the willingness of retailers to feature plant-based brands within their stores. Finally, we are seeing more and more restaurants that have taken to naming their plant-based options by brand on their menu. In the US we’ve seen it with the Beyond Meat and Impossible brands, for example, and we’ve certainly seen that in Australia too, as well as our home country of South Africa where our Big Fry Burger appears by name on restaurant menus. This gives us a lot more exposure to the general public. Tell us about your acquisition by Foods United, now otherwise known as the LIVEKINDLY co – what will this change for Fry’s?
The unique thing about the LIVEKINDLY company is that it is a collective of heritage and start-up plant-based brands that are all mission aligned. For us that was both important and exciting because we knew that in order to take on the US market, which is something that we are very passionate about doing as a family, we were going to need support. The same holds true for additional markets around the world which don’t currently carry Fry’s products. TLKC is, or is set to be, the largest plant-based food company in the world. It also has strategic partners and owns the entire value and supply chain from seed growing to distribution and has the ability to scale very quickly. It’s exciting for us that we can now get our soy and alternative plant proteins directly from the source and manage that entire process of the raw material chain then have global distribution which we didn’t have access to before. It provides us a unique ability to scale up our business as well as providing us with access to territories which we couldn’t have entered on our own. For us as a brand, nothing really changes because the family are all very much still involved. TLKC is value-aligned with us so we can continue to do what we’ve been doing for 30 years. We want to continue to serve our customers, we want transparency, we want to choose ingredients the way we always have with a high set of principles and high quality standards, so none of that will change. Fry’s has recently launched vegan pizzas in Woolworths and Coles in Australia – how did that go?
It’s interesting, the pizzas that are selling in the vegan section of the freezer are doing quite well. Those which are found in the standard meat-based or margarita-style pizza section have been slow to catch on, which is surprising given that plant-based meats are doing well in the meat section. Consumers may be a bit slow in noticing plant-based foods located inside non plant-based sections. We think it may just take some time because the consumer response to the product has been overwhelmingly positive. In which countries do you see the most success, and with which products?
Outside of South Africa, our biggest markets are the UK and Australia. They are also our oldest markets as we have been exporting to those countries for over 18 years. Our most successful products are the pastry products like our award-winning sausage rolls along with our chicken-style nuggets. The Big Fry Burger has been a big hit for us in South Africa—we simply can’t keep up with the demand—so that looks to be a new flagship product for Fry’s and are excited to bring it to the world this year. Our superfood products like the flaxseed and sunflower seed crumbed schnitzel have performed extremely well. Fry’s was due to launch a burger product at Expo West which was obviously postponed – can you expand on that?
As I mentioned, we are currently only in South Africa though we do plan on expanding to the rest of Frys’ markets during 2020. It has been tricky because so many companies are producing quarter pound burgers so when we have an exceptional product like our Big Fry Burger we need to be strategic about when to launch so we stand out from the crowd. Do you have any new products in development which you can tell our readers about?
Although I can’t confirm specific new products at this point we are currently looking at alternative proteins to be featured in new Fry’s products. Those should be coming in 2020/2021.    "

The company is now offering 15 plant-based meals, all created from scratch by Modern Meat Chefs and available in the Greater Vancouver area. The new service is in collaboration with the PlantX platform, which was established to promote, support and create awareness around vegan living. CEO Tara Haddad says, “This is an exciting time for us and these are unprecedented times as many people are not able to leave their homes or prepare nutrient-dense meals themselves.  We want our community to stay strong and I hope our premade meal delivery service will help families and perhaps alleviate some of their daily burden.”  “Attempting to try vegan or incorporate more plant-based foods in your diet can be overwhelming for many and our goal is to simplify the process for people by providing local resources, restaurant suggestions, recipes, shopping and meal delivery,” adds Sean Dollinger, Founder of PlantX.  “We realized quickly that Modern Meat was a company that had the same values around their product offerings, using only simple, natural ingredients, nothing man-made.” After a successful test launch last week, the official launch of the Modern Meat X PlantX meal delivery service is now operational.  Place your order by 8am on Saturday April 4thfor delivery on Monday April 6th.  Orders can be placed at: www.plantx.com    "
11554,Scientists Make Breakthrough in the Production of ‘Slaughter-Free Steak’ Using Soy Protein as a Scaffold to Grow Tissue,https://vegconomist.com/food-and-beverage/scientists-make-breakthrough-in-the-production-of-slaughter-free-steak-using-soy-protein-as-a-scaffold-to-grow-tissue/,2020-04-01,"Researchers from Technion and Aleph Farms in Israel have achieved a breakthrough in the production of cultivated meat. As reported in the journal Nature Food, soy protein has been found to be efficient in the use of scaffolds for growing bovine tissue outside of an animal’s body.  The technology was originally developed for medical applications for tissue engineering in humans transplants by Prof. Levenberg, head of the Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering Lab, director of the Technion Center for 3D Bioprinting. This technology has now been successfully applied to the growing of cultured meat on scaffolds made of soy protein. Aleph Farms was the first company to successfully grow slaughter-free steaks, using original technology developed by Prof. Levenberg and her team. The article in Nature Food demonstrates the scientists’ innovative process for growing cultured meat tissue in only three-to-four weeks that resembles the texture and taste of beef. The process is inspired by nature, meaning that the cells grow in a controlled setting similar to the way they would grow inside a cow’s body. Some of the benefits of the process for the production of cultured meat, which many experts say will be a normal part of life in the near future, are that soy protein is readily available and rich in protein, as well as inexpensive. It is a porous material, and its structure promotes cell and tissue growth. Soy protein’s tiny holes are suitable for cell adherance, division, and proliferation. It also has larger holes that transmit oxygen and nutrients essential for building muscle tissue. Furthermore, soy protein scaffolds for growing cultured meat can be produced in different sizes and shapes, as required. The lab tests have confirmed the resemblance of the meat to slaughtered animal flesh in texture and taste. According to Prof. Levenberg, “We expect that in the future it will be possible to also use other vegetable proteins to build the scaffolds. However, the current research using soy protein is important in proving the feasibility of producing meat from several types of cells on plant-based platforms, which increases its similarity to conventional bovine meat.”    "
11557,Plantbased and the Pandemic – Experts in Vegan Business Speak Out,https://vegconomist.com/hot-off-the-vegan-press/plantbased-and-the-pandemic-experts-in-vegan-business-speak-out/,2020-04-01,"What impact will the pandemic have upon the plantbased food industry? Experts from the GFI, Green Monday, Vevolution, Grounded Foods, Innovate 360, Vegan Business Media, and Green Queen Media, give us their inside knowledge from various areas of vegan industry including startups, foodtech, events, sustainability and media.  While hospitality and foodservice are in troubling times, many businesses are adapting by expanding their online services or adding new delivery options. In what other ways will the vegan industry feel the impact? Although the future is not certain, it seems clear that in this climate of fear, big business will thrive while smaller ventures may or may not survive. Many independent plantbased businesses will be acquired by Big Food as we have already seen taking place this year. There will of course be a huge shift from Bricks and Mortar to online commerce, and food production must of course continue regardless. Despite the current disaster, certain sectors are seeing increased interest and success in these times, for example with meal kit services, and for alternative proteins such as Just Egg, which is now becoming a serious attraction for Chinese state-backed companies seeking alternative protein sources since the outbreak. Let’s see what the experts have to say. Katrina Fox is a PR consultant, speaker, and the founder of Vegan Business Media “The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on all types of vegan and plant-based businesses. In addition to restaurants and bars and the travel and tourism industries, food manufacturers are seeing revenues decreased. Now is a time for vegan and plant-based businesses to ‘pivot’ (the new buzzword of 2020!) to try to diversify their income streams. We’re seeing businesses collaborate, for example, in virtual online markets and I anticipate we’ll see more of this. On the plus side, even though some are scrambling to get an online store up and running now, it means they can be more prepared in the future and possibly have an additional stream of income going forward.” Sonalie Figuerias is the founder of sustainable news platform Green Queen Media “While the F&B industry has always weathered market ups and downs, the coronavirus is a heretofore unrivalled disruption to their way of doing business. No one could have predicted a world where billions of people are no longer able to go to restaurants by government order. Or that serving your customers puts your servers and staff at serious risk for their health. Nimble/innovative operators across the world have already pivoted by introducing takeout menus, frozen ready-meals, prepped food boxes, selling groceries, introducing snacks and condiments, collaborations with other restaurants (e.g. discounts if you dine with all participating eateries), offering online cooking classes, I fully believe that this will not stop post-corona. Restaurants will do everything they can to majorly diversify their revenue streams from now on, so that should this ever happen again, they will be prepared.” David Yeung is the founder of Green Monday and arguably the most influential plantbased businessperson in Asia. “The government will inevitably have to rethink and re-examine the entire food supply chain.  They simply can’t afford to have another devastating incident like the coronavirus ever happen again.  Wildlife animal consumption clearly should have been banned long ago.  Even state-controlled media outlets such as China Daily have published editorials calling for a permanent wildlife trade ban.” Liz Specht, PhD, is the associate director of science and technology at the Good Food Institute. “Fortunately, taking animals out of our food system is easier than we may think. As evidenced by the enormous uptick in innovation, availability, and consumer interest in plant-based meats, the whole meat category is being redefined. Meat is increasingly recognized as a sensory experience, characterized by a specific combination of amino acids, fats, and minerals rather than by its means of production. No animal has to be farmed or hunted and no disease has to be risked to enjoy a juicy burger or a crispy nugget. We are also likely to see cultivated meat (meat grown directly from animal cells, no slaughter involved) enter the market sometime fairly soon, thanks to an influx of talent, investment, and entrepreneurial activity. Both plant-based and cultivated meat products remove the food insecurity and zoonotic disease concerns inherent in animal-based food. Modern plant-based and cultivated meat production gives consumers a painless swap at the dinner table, along with massive underlying benefits in safety and sustainability throughout the supply chain. Governments are pouring immense resources into therapeutic and vaccine development programs in a frantic attempt at damage control for the current outbreak. But none of this will prevent the next, and potentially even worse, pandemic.” From an OpEd piece originally published at Wired Damien Clarkson is the co-founder of Positive Plant-powered movement Vevolution “It is already clear vegan businesses are going to be hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis. Independent restaurants events and those in food service have already been hugely impacted. In London many restaurants have responded immediately by offering no-contact direct delivery services and operating dark kitchens. However businesses operating virtual marketplaces like The Vegan Kind Supermarket have seen unprecedented demand for products as demand increases on direct to consumer services. At Vevolution, we’ve had to adapt our plans and have turned our planned Plant Based Business Summit into a series of virtual events. We are personally excited about the global impact this summit can have as we bring the community of entrepreneurs and investors to discuss how we can continue to grow the plant-based economy.” Veronica Fil is a food industry specialist and economist, as well as founder of vegan cheese startup Grounded Foods. “For us and many other startups in this climate, however, we need to think very carefully about where we direct resources. Things are moving fast, and we’ve got to move with them. That means taking into account how global trade restrictions may impact every aspect of the supply chain, from ingredients and packaging to transport and logistics. How it may create obstacles as well as new opportunities. In the short term, we also need to look at the channels we’re selling through, and how they might be impacted by social distancing (for example, the reduction in physical patronage to restaurants has resulted in an increase in food delivery and online grocery sales). The alternative proteins industry was already a hot market before covid-19 hit. My prediction is that these terrifying times will propel the sector’s growth even faster. As borders are locked down, it’s imperative to explore resilient, self-sustaining and local food supply chains. And for the plant based startups who are on the forefront of innovation? Don’t let a turbulent economy hold you back. Now is the time that we need you most.” Elias Tan is Vice President of Innovate360, Singapore’s 1st food accelerator & incubator “In nations such as Singapore where land area is scarce, the COVID-19 lock-downs demonstrate the need to increase its food production in an inventive matter. Technology will be an important resource in realizing a strong global food security infrastructure. By tapping into cutting edge vertical aquaculture and agri-tech farming system solutions, countries like Singapore can increase its land productivity and maximise its energy and water resources. Despite the current bear stock market, the FoodTech space is definitely an attractive future candidate for investment in the light of a food security issue the world is increasingly facing.

11564,How Vegan Offerings Finally Caught Up With Modern Appetites,https://vegconomist.com/business-insiders/how-vegan-offerings-finally-caught-up-with-modern-appetites/,2020-03-31,"Once a niche trend associated with bland tofu and the frustration of scanning stores to find at least one cruelty-free cosmetics line, veganism has since become a powerful force unlocking a rapidly-growing business segment poised to grow further. The continued momentum, so notable that The Economist named 2019 “the year of the vegan,” only manifests how mainstream the trend is becoming. The ranks of vegans are progressively expanding, with now a quarter of 25- to 34-year-old Americans saying they are either vegans or vegetarians. This seismic force is showing no signs of stopping. So how exactly did vegan offerings finally catch up with modern appetites – and what lies ahead for the whole industry? The main force behind the sector’s growth? Consumers. People are now deciding to go vegan for various reasons: animal welfare, the environment (and global warming), the desire to eat clean and natural, to manage one’s weight, avoid allergies or intolerance towards dairy, and improve the overall health and nutritional landscape. Social media has played a major part in the rise of the plant-based lifestyle – Instagram lists some 90 million posts hashtagged “vegan”. It has also radically transformed the image of veganism; what was viewed as a marginal movement surrounded by many stereotypes has become a widely recognized lifestyle choice, even widely promoted by celebrities including Ellen DeGeneres, Joaquin Phoenix, and Billie Eilish. So as veganism moves towards the mainstream, we’ve seen a clear pressure to think about how convenient it actually is to be a vegan. It’s mainly millennials and younger adults that have been actively pushing for more accessible and diverse plant-based offerings on the market. This has prompted supermarkets across the globe to stock more vegan options, and first vegan listings are now also making it to the menus of big fast-food chains, including McDonald’s, KFC, and Burger King. What are the vegan food frontrunners? U.S. retail sales of plant-based foods have increased by 11 percent over the last year, making it a $4.5 billion industry. Companies across industries have contributed to this growth by expanding their offerings in different, innovative areas. New players entering the meat alternatives market are launching unique products that mimic the taste and texture of authentic meat. Cultured meat is still in the developing phase and is expected to remain so in the next few years, but alternatives based on soy, wheat, pea, rice, faba bean, lentil, and others, are quickly growing. These products now have a dedicated section in retail stores which increases curiosity among consumers, creating and improving sales opportunities for market players. The global meat alternatives market was valued at approximately $5 billion in 2019 and is forecasted to grow by over 11% by 2029. But this could be further accelerated by the growing awareness of the negative impacts of the meat industry on the environment, both among consumers and decision-makers. Another notorious favorite is vegan cheese – and there’s no wonder why. When it comes to veganism, giving up cheese often feels like the greatest struggle because one often has to give up what many feel is a fundamental part of burgers, pizza, burritos, pasta – you name it. But that’s not the case with vegan cheese, the entirely plant-based delight made from coconut oil, soy milk, and plant milk derived from almonds, pine nuts, or cashews. While the biggest demand is seen in vegan mozzarella, segments for cheddar, parmesan, ricotta, and cream cheese are also growing rapidly. The compound annual growth rate of the vegan cheese market is estimated at 8.6% between 2019 and 2028. Still, there’s much more, be it the growing market with egg replacement, tempeh, and pea proteins, among others. Interestingly, vegan pasta is also on the rise. To cut down the consumption of refined carbs, people are increasingly turning to pasta derived from ingredients such as whole grains and legumes. And as many kinds of pasta normally contain eggs, pasta sourced from legumes with different types of lentils emerged as a plant-based choice. The future is vegan  When it comes to vegan food, the future is not only bright but also tasty. The innovative products mentioned above only represent the tip of the iceberg: We’re going to see even more diverse selections flood the market in the upcoming years. While vegan food doesn’t need to imitate the meat-based diet, products like “vegan chicken” – that KFC and A&W are experimenting with – are bringing more media attention and ultimately paving the way for meat-eaters to convert at greater ease. Similarly, products like plant-based jerky made from different kelp, different types of leaves, and mushrooms, are ensuring that vegans don’t experience FOMO in everyday diet. Vegan yogurt, dairy-free chocolate, or varied pastries made of vegan butter or egg replacements, are also going to become increasingly common as companies nail down the science of vegan products. For example, according to the bold claim of Eclipse Food, their vegan ice cream made from potato, corn, cassava, oats, canola oil, cane sugar, and other ingredients, is even creamier than that made of cow milk. Still, we can’t forget that such advances aren’t happening at the same pace globally. North America and Europe are traditionally the main markets for vegan products. South Asia has yet to experience the boom, and the trend hasn’t penetrated Oceania significantly either. However, this scenario may change in the upcoming years with the emergence of Australia as the third-largest vegan product consuming country in the world. We are now experiencing perhaps the greatest diet shift in centuries. Thanks to consumer pressure and innovations in the market, vegan offerings are now more diverse than ever and hardly limit the person in their diet. And looking at the market development, it seems like the best is yet to come! Special guest post from Sudip Saha, Managing Director and Co-Founder of Future Market Insights      "
11567,Peace of Meat: Belgian Startup Aims to Transform a $163 Billion Dollar Industry With Cultured Fats,https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/peace-of-meat-belgian-startup-aims-to-transform-a-163-billion-dollar-industry-with-cultured-fats/,2020-03-30,"With only 20 grams of fat, the startup Peace of Meat shows how to transform a multi billion-dollar industry and how nutrition will develop in the future. Co-founder Eva Sommer predicts that mass production of cultured meat will soon be a reality and in response has developed her first products – cultured animal fat and liver.  In an increasingly crowded market place, Peace of Meat has already overcome the first hurdle with its product. They are the first manufacturers in Europe to be able to produce a GMO-free stem cell line that allows the production of the forecast volumes. Peace of Meat has produced 20 grams of fat as proof of concept in the laboratory as part of the mission to create hybrid meats. “With this we could produce about 200 grams of hybrid meat. But the laboratory is not sufficient for larger quantities.” The 20 grams should be turned into 100,000 tons in just ten years. For the startup, it is therefore no longer a question of producing a prototype. It would be about building production plants of industrial size to supply existing players in the market with their fat – a B2B business. In order to underline her point of view, co-founder von Heinrichshorst cites A. T. Kearney’s study ‘How will Cultured Meat and Meat Alternatives disrupt the Agricultural and Food Industry?’ The forecasts of the study not only arouse enthusiasm among the Peace of Meat founders. The expectations are high. No less than 60 percent of the meat market is at stake, which cultivated and plant-based products are expected to account for together by 2040. If Peace of Meat manages to make its vision of a hybrid meat market come true, they will be looking at a profitable business. “Edible fat is a $163 billion market,” von Heinrichshorst explains. According to the trio, a large part of this market is fed by monocultures and factory farming. Reason enough for the founders to set about replacing the system in large parts. Even today, they would be looking at a seven billion dollar market if they were to consider the fat for meat alternatives alone.    "

11587,OpEd: COVID 19 as an Accelerator of Food Tech,https://vegconomist.com/business-insiders/oped-covid-19-as-an-accelerator-of-food-tech/,2020-03-25,"It was said to have begun at a wholesale animal market in Wuhan City which health officials have strongly suggested as the starting point of the outbreak. However, COVID-19 is not the only animal virus to have originated from meat consumption. This includes H1N1 (Bird Flu) and the Mad Cow Disease. Our attention is then turned to plant based proteins or even clean meats as a healthier and disease free option.  The following article was originally published here by Elias Tan at Innovate 360 in Singapore. As this information here will be of interest to our readers, the author has kindly agreed for us to reproduce this content. Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods and Tyson’s “plant based meats” are great starting points for alternative protein innovation as meat industries begin to get disrupted by the constant outbreak of animal related diseases. Apart from producing alternatives to animal meat, a new wave of clean technology companies have arisen to produce clean meats in laboratories. Memphis Meats and Shiok Meats are great examples of companies spearheading research in this area in USA and Singapore respectively. Instead harvesting meat for consumption from slaughtered animals, the meat grown in their laboratories are produced by the culture of animal stem cells.  During the COVID-19 outbreak, it is important that having a good nutrition intake enables us to maintain an optimal immune system. Research has shown that the human body can fight off viruses and that we can take measures to supercharge our immunity. At the moment, there is a growing incentive to innovate on healthy and nutritional foods for companies like Hoow Foods. With the use of Artificial Intelligence technology, Hoow Foods reformulates popular foods that are usually known to be unhealthy, into healthier versions without compromising its taste.  Dr. Sherman(left) and Mr. Ow, founders of reformulation business Hoow Foods, which helps company make healthier products in a shorter time and as tasty. On the other hand, Kombynation Co. targets a healthy gut through its handcrafted kombucha beverage which contains over 30 strains of friendly bacteria and yeast known for its gut health boosting and energizing properties. The immune system requires a healthy gut to provide nourishment as it contains over 70 percent of the cells of the immune system. National Lock-downs driving Food Tech Innovation & Singapore’s 30 by 30 Due to the virus outbreak, numerous governments have began to close their borders and place their cities on lock-down. With the news, the world is seeing food stock-outs and empty supermarket shelves everywhere due to widespread panic buying. Under a lock-down situation, the free flow and transportation of goods and food supply chains across borders are disrupted.  Notably, Singapore, imports more than 90% of its food. During times of crisis, the Singapore government has indicated that the country at best has around three months’ worth of food stockpile at a national level. This greatly strengthens the need for “30 by 30 vision” to be made a reality, where Singapore has set the target of producing 30% of its nutritional needs by 2030, up from less than 10% today. The aim is to increase the cultivation of vegetables and fruit and boost the production of protein sources to strengthen the resilience of Singapore’s food supply and food security. Furthermore, in nations such as Singapore where land area is scarce, the COVID-19 lock-downs demonstrate the need to increase its food production in an inventive matter. Technology will be an important resource in realizing a strong global food security infrastructure. By tapping into cutting edge vertical aquaculture and agri-tech farming system solutions, countries like Singapore can increase its land productivity and maximise its energy and water resources. National lock-downs in times like these also provide global citizens a unique opportunity to “tweak” their food lifestyle choices. People are forced to learn to cook at home and even produce their own food supply through the use of home Agri-tech farming systems. One local company working to create this solution is NOSH Produce, a high tech intensive container farming system to be used for vegetable production in Singapore. NOSH Produce aims to lease out its farming systems to Singaporeans who can grow their own vegetable produce in the comfort of their homes through the use of hydroponics technology. Post COVID-19 Situation driving Food Technology Investments Despite the current bear stock market, the FoodTech space is definitely an attractive future candidate for investment in the light of a food security issue the world is increasingly facing. According to PitchBook, funding for food tech has skyrocketed from about $60 million in 2008 to more than $1 billion in 2015. And unique investments from VCs and private equity funds have doubled from 223 in 2015 to 459 in 2017, according to CB Insights. With the growing COVID-19 situation, Food Tech companies producing solutions that enhance the world’s food supply in times of calamity would be a choice investment.

Supported by the Singapore Food Agency and the Singapore Land Authority and located at Paya Lebar, the 50,000 sq ft facility hopes to start production in a few months. Initially, the company will focus on marketing directly through a B2B model but plans are underway to extend distribution directly to consumers, as well as to hotels, caterers and food services. The pilot facility will officially launch in the fourth quarter of 2020, while plans to start another bigger production facility are also underway. It plans to reach out to nearby schools, retirement homes and community service centres offering community outreach to help educate people in switching to plant-based. Life3 Biotech founder Mr Ricky Lin told the Business Times: “Over the past few years, the alternative protein market has been growing rapidly, and global competitors have started entering the South-east Asian market. Right now would be the most opportune time for us to enter this market as well. We want to reshape Singaporeans’ thinking towards sustainable food sources and create more job opportunities for locals in this emerging industry. With an actionable roadmap that we have set up to achieve, we believe Life3 Biotech will contribute positively towards Singapore’s drive towards sustainability and food security.”    "
11597,GFI Awards $4 million for Scientists to Address Issues Including Zoonotic Disease & Antibiotic Resistance,https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/gfi-awards-4-million-for-scientists-to-address-issues-including-zoonotic-disease-antibiotic-resistance/,2020-03-24,"The Good Food Institute’s Competitive Research Grant Program, which has allocated $7 million to 35 open-access research initiatives since 2019, has today awarded $4 million to 21 of the world’s leading scientists to fill gaps in plant-based and cultivated meat science.  The GFI’s $4 million in grants, funded thanks to gifts from “visionary donors”, has been awarded to 21 leading scientists from nine countries: Australia, Brazil, Israel, the Netherlands, Portugal, Serbia, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. The Competitive Research Grant Program supports open-access research that advances the science of plant-based and cultivated meat — technologies poised to revolutionize the food system and address the many issues associated with conventional meat production, from food scarcity and climate change to zoonotic disease and antibiotic resistance.  The 2020 grantees are top biochemists, tissue engineers, computational modeling experts, plant geneticists, and food scientists whose research projects address the crucial technical bottlenecks facing the plant-based and cultivated meat industries, with research specifically focused on taste, texture, cost, and scale-up improvements. “Plant-based meat and cultivated meat have the potential to transform the global food system, but this requires the industries to overcome significant technical hurdles that remain on the path to price parity, scaleup, and commercialization,” said GFI Executive Director Bruce Friedrich. “Building a robust foundation of open-access data will enable the entire sector to advance more efficiently and bring plant-based and cultivated meat to the masses.” 2020 GRANTEE HIGHLIGHTS — Dr. Marianne Ellis, University of Bath, UK. Marianne’s lab is developing a cellular agriculture life-cycle pod for cultivated meat production. This more compact, cost-effective cultivated meat production system will make cultivated meat more accessible and affordable for more people and enable production in remote locations and developing countries. — Dr. Marieke Bruins, Wageningen University, Netherlands. Marieke’s lab is harnessing plant proteins from agricultural waste and side streams as a highly sustainable method of producing plant-based meat — Dr. Sara Oliveira, INL, Portugal. Sara and her team are creating M3atD, a 3-D bioprinted model for cultivated meat design. This project will examine the variables affecting the cell behavior and properties of printable bioinks and explore how 3-D printing may be successfully applied to cultivated meat production. — Prof. Che Connon, Newcastle University, UK. Che’s lab uses macromolecular crowding (MMC) to enhance meat cultivation. This project seeks to identify potential MMC substrates from existing agricultural side streams and the ways these may be used to grow muscle and fat cells more efficiently. MMC is an inexpensive method of increasing cell density and yield and could improve cultivated meat tissue density, reduce media costs, and lessen the need for growth factors.

It was recently revealed that Puris has just received an additional $25 million which apparently has come from an undisclosed source.  According to Twin Cities Business, Puris officials have declined to respond to requests for comment. The company, whose CEO is former NFL player Tyler Lorenzen, said at the point of the Cargill investment that it planned to use the funds to double production of pea protein at a facility in  Minnesota. In addition to the continuingly increasing supply of pea protein for the alternative protein industry, Puris also developed a vegan alternative to animal-derived gelatine which uses pea starch. The new plant-based product is capable to replace both gelatine and pectin in gummy sweets. Beyond Meat revealed its financial report earlier this month, predicting net revenues in the range of $490 million to $510 million, an increase of 64% to 71% from 2019 to 2020.    "
11620,Singapore Emerges as the “Food Tech Ecosystem” of Asia,https://vegconomist.com/society/singapore-emerges-as-the-food-tech-ecosystem-of-asia/,2020-03-17,"Asia has been cited in a recent report as the continent to watch as the alternative protein industry takes shape globally. Within Asia, Singapore is emerging as the food tech capital, with its government investing $100 billion (US$72 billion) to prepare for the effects of the current climate crisis.  A core part of this plan will involve measures to be self-sufficient and battle food insecurity, as Singapore is a heavily urban city-state that imports 90% of its food, largely due to its limited land space. After the announcement last year of the intention to produce 30% of the country’s nutritional needs locally by 2030, Singapore has been investing heavily in alternative protein research and development. Andrew Ive, Founder & GP at Big Idea Ventures, a venture firm which has invested in clean meat innovators such as Shiok Meats, said: “At Big Idea Ventures we have worked with many different governments but without question Singapore has put all of the resource into the food sector above and beyond what we have seen. It is quite incredible to see all arms of the government from investment, development, research and regulatory work together to drive this sector.” There is no shortage of food tech innovation in Singapore, ranging from Shiok Meats’ cell-based shrimp to TurtleTree Labs’ world’s first lab-grown dairy and human breast milk. Last month,  Swiss food technology provider Bühler Holding AG, together with Givaudan, announced a new Innovation Center dedicated to plant-based food in Singapore. Last summer, a clean meat laboratory was opened in Singapore, with the Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat stating he was looking forward to the lab’s food and the prospect of the health benefits offered by clean meat. This followed last April’s revelation that Singapore would invest $535 million USD to transform its economy, including S$144 million for food-related innovations in order to help sustainable and local production. In September, new agritech investment company called Germi8 was launched by a team of entrepreneurs from biotech, agricultural machinery, education, food, and technology, to place funding into agrifood startups through its extended investment vehicles. The aim of the group is to advance the development of alternative proteins and clean meat. The government has also appointed a full-time Alternative Protein Analyst dedicated to aiding the growth of the industry. Also, it is matching the amount of funding that Singaporean startups raise, to help the growth of some of the most groundbreaking companies to lead on creating sustainable food solutions. Sonalie Figueiras, founder of Asian platform Green Queen Media, commented to vegconomist: “Singapore has truly forged itself as the food tech ecosystem in Asia thanks to an incredibly supportive government, some of the region’s best industry events and pioneering entrepreneurs choosing to make the city their headquarters.”    "
11631,Food Startups in the Climate of Coronavirus: Could Some Businesses be Immune?,https://vegconomist.com/society/food-startups-in-the-climate-of-coronavirus-could-some-businesses-be-immune/,2020-03-16,"Exhibitors at Expo West, which usually attracts over 85,000 people, were left gutted last month when the event was cancelled as they were still setting up their booths. For the startups who had already invested heavily in getting there, the cancellation was a signal of major, unrecoverable financial losses to come.  By food economist Veronica Fil. “But not everyone has suffered. While segments of our economy have slowed to a standstill, attention has suddenly turned to plant based pioneers—and their potential role in future food security. Could this be the opportunity that none of us expected? Nobody knows what’s going to happen next, when the crisis will end, or when toilet paper will be back in stock. But here’s the perspective of my own plant based startup, Grounded Foods, and how covid-19 has impacted our business. At the time Expo West was cancelled, I was in California on the fundraising trail for Grounded. Our flight into San Francisco had been eerily empty, and as a result of the show being called off, several of the investors who we were scheduled to meet up with also cancelled their trips. Over the coming days, more meetings were postponed. Some VC’s had already closed their office doors to work from home. Unwilling to let this slow us down, we spent hundreds of dollars mailing out product samples to their home addresses instead. The day that we arrived back in New York to officially announce our fundraising round, Wall St tanked—taking its greatest dive since the 2008 financial crisis. I felt like I was going to throw up. Not for my own non-existent stock portfolio, but for the impact that this could have on investor confidence. What a time to be alive (and asking for money). Given that uncertainty is the natural enemy of investors, I figured VC’s would immediately zip up their purses and wait for the situation to play out. For startups who are currently raising, that’s a big problem. Fuelled with speculation, some founders might panic and accept much lower valuations in the rush to raise cash. Even worse, some might not have the runway to survive over the next few months, and risk burning out of resources altogether if they fail to secure capital. My uneasiness grew when some of our food service customers put their orders on hold. A chain reaction was in effect: with more people staying home to ride out the virus, small restaurants had cut back on staff, opening hours and supplies. Other friends in the startup community were experiencing similar issues; threatened by the prospect that they may run out of money while waiting for sales to pick up again. That’s where things got interesting. Because, despite this troubling turn of events (and my regular panic attacks), major accounts suddenly started knocking at our door. Specifically supermarket chains, quick service franchises and meal kit delivery companies, all contacting us out of the blue asking for samples, spec sheets, and to lock in purchase orders. At the same time, VC’s from all over the world—particularly the Asia Pacific region—started requesting meetings to find out more about our dairy-free products. This took me by surprise. But before long a trend became clear: although I’d initially bought into the panic (and seen other startups freak out in the viral fallout), those working in the plant based ecosystem appeared to be getting stronger. Josh Tetrick, for instance—the CEO of plant based egg startup Just Inc.—said that his company has had a sudden surge of interest from Chinese food manufacturers looking for egg alternatives, in an attempt to strengthen the domestic food supply chain. Meanwhile, New Crop Capital, alongside Dao Foods, had just invested in Chinese alternative meat venture Starfield—proving that forward thinking investors are not backing down. If anything, they’re recognising the growth potential of the alternative proteins market more than ever. At Grounded, we inadvertently found ourselves in the sweet spot: a startup not only addressing demand for plant based products, but doing so in a way that supports food security and environmental resilience. Unlike larger companies, we’re not tethered to multinational supply chains, and we’re still at the stage of infancy where we can make fast decisions. For us and many other startups in this climate, however, we need to think very carefully about where we direct resources. Things are moving fast, and we’ve got to move with them. That means taking into account how global trade restrictions may impact every aspect of the supply chain, from ingredients and packaging to transport and logistics. How it may create obstacles as well as new opportunities. In the short term, we also need to look at the channels we’re selling through, and how they might be impacted by social distancing (for example, the reduction in physical patronage to restaurants has resulted in an increase in food delivery and online grocery sales). We’re living in pretty bizarre times. One of my previous posts discussed the economic impact of Australia’s bushfires, and the opportunities that this could create in the plant based sector. Now I find myself writing about a deadly pandemic that, once again, is steering governments, investors, major corporates and even consumers towards alternative protein sources. The alternative proteins industry was already a hot market before covid-19 hit. My prediction is that these terrifying times will propel the sector’s growth even faster. As borders are locked down, it’s imperative to explore resilient, self-sustaining and local food supply chains. And for the plant based startups who are on the forefront of innovation? Don’t let a turbulent economy hold you back. Now is the time that we need you most.”    "
11639,New Crop Capital and Dao Foods Invest in Chinese Alt Meat Startup Starfield,https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/new-crop-capital-and-dao-foods-invest-in-chinese-alt-meat-startup-starfield/,2020-03-13,"It was announced yesterday that China-focused impact investor Dao Foods International, in partnership with New Crop Capital, an early investor of Beyond Meat and over 30 other alternative protein ventures around the world, has invested in Starfield Food and Science Technology Limited. This marks NCC’s first investment in China.  Starfield Food and Science Technology Limited, a next-generation Chinese food technology company headquartered in Shenzhen, a city of nearly 13 million people and a leading global technology hub bordering Hong Kong, is a plant-based meat venture targeting at primarily China’s 400 million millennials. Starfield is considered the only Chinese next-gen alternative meat venture that has its own R&D and manufacturing capability. Starfield has already has reached product collaboration intents with over 20 local and international restaurants, including restaurant chains Papa Johns with 170 outlets, Nayuki’s Tea with 300 branches, and Element Fresh with 38 restaurants in the country. The startup produces a ground meat product which is used in many different applications such as “Future Meatball Pizza” at Papa Johns, “Lemongrass Satay” at Brut Eatery, “Green Star Burger” at Nayuki’s Tea, “Starfield Fried Rice” at Planet Green. It owns a patent for a seaweed protein and has established R&D partnerships with Beijing Technology and Business University, Shenzhen University and Jiangnan University, a few Chinese academic institutions that lead research work and efforts in the alternative meat field. Matrix Partners China, a leading Chinese venture capital firm, led the angel investment round for Starfield together with NCC and Dao Foods. Matrix has invested in over 600 Chinese startup ventures, including Ele.me, one of China’s largest food delivery services delivering over 16 million orders a day across over 2000 cities in China. Joy Capital, another top Chinese venture capital firm that has invested in Nasdaq-listed Chinese coffee shop chain Luckin Coffee, also invested in Starfield in a plus investment round immediately after Matrix China, NCC and Dao Foods.  “Dao Foods has been on the look-out for promising companies and entrepreneurs that both understand the taste buds of millennial consumers, and have the skills to develop and continuously improve products to meet this discerning taste. We have enjoyed working with the team at Starfield over the past year, and are extremely excited about our investment and the next phase of growth for the company,” said Albert Tseng, co-founder of Dao Foods International. The press release refers to a recent South China Morning Post article, as vegconomist reported about here. The article contains the quote, “China is said to be preparing to restructure meat production and distribution system after the latest coronavirus crisis,” which could serve as “a catalyst to producers of plant-based meat substitutes.”  “We are incredibly excited about this investment in Starfield, our first in China. Through our partners at Dao Foods, we are tracking this sector in China very carefully. We believe there is great potential to accelerate the adoption of plant-based meats throughout the region. Each of the investors in this round brings significant strategic value, and we will contribute our international plant-based food expertise to the growth of Starfield,” added Chris Kerr, Chief Investment Officer, New Crop Capital.

This interest group is to act as an independent interface between the media, industry, research, consumers and politics.  The association has now published a first overview of the players in the field of alternative proteins in Germany. It is certainly not complete, but balpro is looking forward to any information on other players. The new association is committed to the following goals: Further strengthening Germany’s pioneering role by promoting sustainable and innovative nutritional solutions “Alternative protein sources have the potential to change the food industry in the long term and are already operating very successfully on international markets,” explains co-founder Fabian Ziemßen. “That’s why we should continue to push this future topic, especially at the strong innovation location of Germany, in order to play a pioneering role in the market. After all, while Germany is lagging behind in other future technologies such as e-mobility, we have the chance to play a pioneering role worldwide here.    "

In a similar way that major players in the meat industry have capitalised on the global surge in plantbased, GlobalData says it sees similar opportunities for the seafood industry, as more and more consumers are concerned about the provenance of their food and the environmental impact of their buying habits. Yamina Tsalamlal, Consumer Analyst at GlobalData, says: “Unlike plant-based burgers, seafood has been quite challenging to replicate and has seen a slower pace in terms of innovations. But the seafood industry continues to grow – per capita consumption of seafood increased by 10% between 2015 and 2019, resulting in 37,351.94kg (in M of KG)*.” Similarly to how the alternative meat industry grew exponentially, thanks to concerns regarding the overconsumption of meat and the environmental impact, the demand for seafood continues to increase and there is concern that the industry will not be able to meet demand. Tsalamlal adds that: “For new entries into this market, consider the key players that are growing in the alt-seafood market such as Wild Type, Good Catch (now in Tesco) and Ocean Hugger. But there isn’t a market leader yet. “The opportunity lies in marketing the positive environmental impact alt-seafood has and how consumers can opt for accessible, healthy and ocean-friendly foods.”      "
11722,EthicaMeat: Committed to Constructing a “World in Which Anyone Who Wants to Eat Meat Can do so Without Killing an Animal”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/ethicameat-committed-to-constructing-a-world-in-which-anyone-who-wants-to-eat-meat-can-do-so-without-killing-an-animal/,2020-02-27,"Ethicameat is the cultivated meat brand of Biotech Foods, a pioneering Spanish company that says it is driving a revolution in the global food market; natural slaughter-free animal meat. Ethicameat says it is addressing the high demand for animal-based protein and reducing the current impact of the production process on the environment through sustainable solutions. We were pleased to speak with Iñigo Charola, CEO of Biotech Foods about their brand EthicaMeat, the future of protein and the role in which cultured meat will play. Who is the team behind Ethica Meat?
The company comprises a diverse team of experts in biomedicine, specialising in tissue regeneration and nanomedicine, which covers process engineering and pharmacology and biotechnology, in combination with a deep understanding of the food market. Mercedes Vila is our Co-Founder and CTO of Ethicameat. She has a PhD in Materials Physics from the Autonoma University of Madrid-CSIC, and more than 16 years of experience in the design and application of materials in biomedicine and the understanding of surface interactions between cells and materials. In 2010 she was awarded the L’ORÉAL-UNESCO ‘For Women in Science’ Prize in recognition of her scientific career. In 2012 she was appointed Distinguished Researcher through the I3 Programme of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology and she has been awarded three times the Marie-Sklodowska Curie Action of the European Commission. Since the beginning of her career Vila has worked on the possibilities offered by tissue engineering and nanomedicine in the field of regeneration and treatment of the human body. In 2017 Vila cofounded BioTech Foods, the company that produces Ethicameat, the cultivated meat brand of Biotech Foods. Iñigo Charola is CEO and Co-Founder of BioTech Foods. He has a degree in Business Administration from the University of Wales, a Masters in Marketing Management from the prestigious ESIC Business & Marketing School and an MBA from the University of Deusto, as well as numerous leadership programs in Business Administration. He has developed his career as business director in several industries, including food technology, for more than 20 years. Why cultured meat, and why now?
Factory farming meat production model is developed on an unsustainable scale for a depleted planet. Today, factory farming accounts for 25% of the land and water use on the planet and 15% of greenhouse gas emissions. Sustained development of this model is threatening the existing and long-term capacity of the Earth’s resources. We are therefore facing the challenge of an unsustainable model in the long-term. Global demand for protein currently stands at 202 million tonnes a year. This includes all types of meat and fish. This demand is forecast to increase to 1000 million tonnes by 2050, according to the latest data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. This means that it is essential to find a sustainable alternative that, combining the most advanced technology with environmental protection, meets future demand. Cultivated meat production uses much fewer resources: 99% less land, 75% less water and 90% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than similar meat products. What is your company mission and how do you hope to achieve it?
The mission of BioTech Foods is to commit to the construction of a world in which anyone who wants to eat meat can do so without killing an animal. A world where animal welfare, food safety and innovation would be the values that drive our species out to a more sustainable planet. What will your portfolio be and when will the products be available?
BioTech Foods works on pork meat and have plans to expand to poultry after that. We are currently developing our product offering for the consumer. Biotech Foods is collaborating with meat processing companies to obtain the final format of Ethicameat products, that will be launched in a range of consumer products such as sausages, ham and nuggets. The selected species give us a huge variety of potential products. Ethicameat is currently in the production scaling and regulation stage, before starting with the commercialization. Where will your products be on sale, in which markets?
Biotech Foods is collaborating with meat processing companies to obtain the final format of Ethicameat products that will be launched initially in the EU and in the US after first market introduction. Are you seeking partners?
We are very proud of the fact that our company already has raised over 2.5 million euros and our plan is to reach our short-term goals. We think collaboration is key to bring this new products into the market, so we keep collaborations in all parts of the value chain and we expect to keep growing those collaborations. What are your plans for 2020 and the next few years?
We now have the technology developed and we are now in the scale up process to bring cultivated meat to industrial production. In the long term, we want to become a consumer alternative to traditional meat, a means to a much more important goal: sustainability between meat consumption, respect for animal welfare and the environment. How do you foresee the future of the meat industry and which part will cultivated meat play? Are people ready for it in 2020?
There are different forecasts about how protein consumption is going to evolve. What all of them have in common is that they predict a decrease of consumption of factory farming meat and plant bases and cultivated meat to be a substantial part of the proteins we consume. Some reports estimate this trend will keep rising to 2040, when cultivated meat will have a 35% share of all protein consumption. Both production methods will undoubtedly co-exist because the consumer will demand it, but there seems to be no doubt that the overall production model will benefit.    "
11723,Cultured Meat Has Potential to Decimate $945.7bn Global Beef Industry,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/cultured-meat-has-potential-to-decimate-945-7bn-global-beef-industry/,2020-02-27,"Investment platform currency.com has published a report from an investor’s perspective, saying that cultured meat is a significant market opportunity.  The global cultured meat market is predicted to be worth $15.5m by 2021 and $20m by 2027.  Cultured meat includes beef, pork, chicken and seafood and also in recent times the colossal $113.08bn dog and cat food market too. Researchers estimate that 35 per cent of all meat will be cultured by 2040. In the short term most companies are venture-backed, privately owned and out of reach for everyday investors. It is possible, however, that several, especially those based in the US, could IPO at some point in the future following the success of Beyond Meat which took this route in May 2019. Existing companies could acquire some of the most innovative startups and build businesses around them; “There would be no shortage of potential suitors from existing food giants through to start-ups such as Beyond and its key US rival Impossible Foods,” states the article. “Interestingly almost all the giant tech start-ups have investments in the cultured-meat industry. So it is not beyond the realms of possibility that Amazon or even Google could end up as a market leader in this space, providing they can get the acquisitions past regulators.” Cultured meat has the potential, according to currency.com, to decimate the beef industry which globally is worth $945.7bn – the farming industry is fighting back on two fronts. First, it is calling into question the quality and safety of cultured meat. And secondly, it is attempting to ensure that the new product is not labelled as meat. “The next few years will be pivotal for the cultured meat market[…] It is clearly an area on which investors need to keep a very close eye.”    "
11741,"Cargill, Inc. to Launch a Plant-Based Protein Line to Compete With Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods",https://vegconomist.com/food-and-beverage/cargill-inc-to-launch-a-plant-based-protein-line-to-compete-with-beyond-meat-impossible-foods/,2020-02-24,"According to Reuters, Cargill, Inc. announced plans to launch a range of pea and soy-protein-based hamburger patties and ground products in April. The introduction of its new plant-based protein is to challenge Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods in grocery stores, restaurants, and cafeterias.  Cargill’s entry into the plant-based protein arena is in response to increased demand for meat-free options. Reasons for consumer’s transition to meat-free alternatives include concerns for personal health, the environment, and animal welfare. The plant-based protein products will allow Retailers to sell the products under their labels. Beyond Meat, products are made using pea protein, and Impossible Foods uses soy protein. “On both, we’re competing,” Elizabeth Gutschenritter, managing director of Cargill’s alternative protein, said. “We are offering a portfolio that will encompass both pea and soy formulations.” North American pea-protein producer Puris is a supplier to Cargill and Beyond Meat. Cargill has announced investments of $100 million in Puris since January 2018 and benefited from the investment due to limited supplies of pea protein, Gutschenritter said. “Cargill is a huge organization, and so we deal with being both supplier and competitor in a lot of different areas,” she said. “Being able to have that raw material supply has been helpful for us for sure. According to Cargill, it has invested $7BN in animal protein in the last five years. By comparison, investments in alternative proteins are in the “low single-digit percentages,” Gutschenritter said. “It’s still such a small portion of the investments that we’re making,” she said.

11746,Report Into Asia’s Alternative Protein Market Reveals Huge Potential For Growth,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/report-into-asias-alternative-protein-market-reveals-huge-potential-for-growth/,2020-02-24,"Green Queen Media has recently released an in-depth report that provides a comprehensive overview of the alternative protein industry across Asia. The report highlights the complexities in the Asian market but ultimately that it has the potential to be the leader in creating global change.  The report did not factor in insect protein as this is not considered slaughter-free but does cite cell-based meat, plant-based protein and wholefood proteins such as jackfruit/king oyster mushrooms as alternatives. Due to population growth, meat and seafood consumption in Asia will rise 78% by 2050, despite recent damage to the meat industry with animal derived diseases. Asia will be responsible for 73% of the seafood increase, taking over more than two-thirds of the available seafood supply in the world. Entrepreneurs in the region are indeed already pioneering their own solutions; local brands including Omnipork, Zhenmeats and Shiok Meats are gearing up to disrupt the market, coinciding with the emergence of western companies like Impossible Foods who also can see the vast potential in Asian markets. Despite China producing 70% of the world’s soy and Asia being familiar with animal free protein for centuries, one of the key challenges that the start-up’s in the region face is the difficulty in raising capital. Silicon Valley is alight with announcements of large ticket funding rounds – Impossible Foods recently announced a US$ 300 million Series E – but in Asia, they have yet to see even a single series A announcement for a local company. The general sentiment is that investors in Asia tend to be more conservative than investors in other innovation hubs such as Silicon Valley. It’s worth noting that while Asia-based start-ups have difficulty finding investors, many large Asia-based investors are investing heavily in US-based alternative protein companies. Li Ka-Shing’s Horizons Ventures and Singapore government-backed Temasek Holdings, both of whom have invested in Impossible Foods and plant-based egg producer JUST. Sonalie Figueiras, Founder & Editor-in-Chief of Green Queen Media and co-author of this report, said to vegconomist: “By 2050, there will be 5 billion people in Asia, the world’s most populous region and food insecurity is a massive threat for the region. To solve this, we need massive innovation in alt protein. The opportunity to disrupt the global food system is right here and our mission with this report is to make sure the whole world knows it.”    "
11768,Could Australia’s Bushfires be a Turning Point for Plant-Based Production?,https://vegconomist.com/food-and-beverage/could-australias-bushfires-be-a-turning-point-for-plant-based-production/,2020-02-18,"As we announced last week, vegconomist is pleased to welcome Veronica Fil – former economic advisor to the Australian government, food industry expert, and founder of vegan brand Grounded Foods along with husband, chef Shaun Quade. In this first special guest post Veronica speaks about a matter especially close to her own heart. “As an Australian, I can only describe the recent bushfires as apocalyptic. Terrifying. A crisis so extreme, that it feels almost unreal to watch from the safety of a screen. Sadly, the reality is still setting in: more than 1 billion animals perished in the flames. It’s not over yet, and the toll is still climbing. Understandably, focus has been on the immediate damage caused by the crisis. But that’s only the beginning of a much greater impact I see this could have on Australia’s food system. For dairy farming in particular, it may even be a catalyst for major disruption. In the leadup… Even before the bushfires, dairy farmers were struggling. Drought, combined with high input costs and rock-bottom supermarket pricing, was crippling small producers. But then came the blaze. As it swept through dairy farmland across Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania, it took entire ecosystems with it. Not only the animals used in agricultural production, but everything living, including grass, trees, insects and birds. Farming infrastructure was impacted: water contaminated; roads blocked; equipment ruined; land razed. Faced with power shortages and road obstructions, some farmers were forced to pour thousands of litres of milk down the drain each day, while others euthanized their badly injured cows to avoid further suffering. Initial impacts… Immediately, supplies of fresh milk to some areas became limited. But it’s unlikely that these shortages will persevere for long—especially not when Big Dairy is on the case. Unlike the small-scale farmers who have been left shattered by the crisis, major companies such as Fonterra, Freedom Foods and Bega remain adamant that the fires will cause minimal disruption to their operations. Supermarkets are unlikely to save the little guys by raising milk prices either. Farmers have been rallying Australia’s Big 3 supermarkets (Woolworths, Coles and Aldi) for years now, pushing for fairer compensation per litre. But as Richard Holden, Professor of Economics at UNSW points out, supermarkets are just one cog in a greater supply chain that controls this. In reality, price volatility in the international dairy market plays a much larger role in determining what farmers get paid—and as a result, “Neither government intervention nor higher retail prices can do much to help them.” For many of Australia’s independent farmers, I think this could be the final blow in what’s been a long round of punches. Prior to the fires, the signs were already pointing to our local industry being vulnerable, inefficient and badly broken. Now, despite the haze of smoke, those signs have never been clearer: the time to re-evaluate our dairy industry is now. This is not a conversation about the ethics of dairy production, but one about the sustainability of our food system and economy as it exists today. After all: if something isn’t working, and if there are such serious inefficiencies at play, then surely it’s time to look for a new way. Turning challenge into opportunity… In the US, former dairy farmers are already converting their land for oat and hemp production—core ingredients for many plant based dairy foods. With global demand for alternative proteins continuing to rise, Australia seems uniquely positioned to take a similar lead; to diversify and strengthen its agricultural capabilities as part of the plant based supply chain. It’s an opportunity that economists at CSIRO’s strategic advisory branch, CSIRO Futures, have already acknowledged. In the report released late last year, titled Growth opportunities for Australian food and agribusiness, CSIRO estimated that the domestic and export opportunities for alternative proteins could reach AUD $4.1b and AUD $2.5b respectively by 2030. That is, of course, if we start dedicating resources towards capturing that potential. Research estimates that meat and dairy production accounts for 60% of greenhouse gas emissions produced by agriculture, and that even low-impact meat and dairy products are likely to cause more environmental harm than sustainably farmed vegetables. CSIRO analysis estimates that consumption of alternative proteins may create an additional $5.4B in carbon emission and water savings annually by 2030. Geographical proximity to key markets such as Singapore and China, along with a thriving (yet largely under-acknowledged) agri tech sector, back up the business case even further. So why aren’t we doing it already? To make it happen, we need support… There’s no quick fix solution to what, in all honesty, is a deeply complex issue—and one that I’m in no position to advise on. Land cannot simply be converted to a cabbage patch or plant based burger factory overnight; some dedicated dairy farmland is not suitable for growing vegetable crops, and the pastures burnt by bushfire will require significant water resources in order to even regenerate. But with the right support, this could signify a genuine turning point. We need the incentives in place to help farmers repurpose part of (or in some instances all of) their land for plant based agriculture. We need programs in place that encourage outside-of-the-box thinking, novel solutions. And we need money. From the government, from the investment community and believe it or not, from the big businesses that have emerged unscathed. Let’s not forget the role of international corporations either. Companies like Tyson, McCain and Nestle—all extremely not vegan companies—are backing the plant based boom, and they’re putting big dollars behind the competitive hunt for innovation. I’d love to see Australia’s agri tech sector and local farmers benefit from their investment. Because funnily enough, it might just be their pursuit of plant based profit that saves us.” 1. ‘Vital Signs: why more expensive milk won’t help farmers much’, The Conversation, Feb 2019, http://theconversation.com/vital-signs-why-more-expensive-milk-wont-help-farmers-much-112145 2.

11797,USA: Research Suggests the Start of a “Dietary Revolution” Focused on Alternative Protein,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/usa-research-suggests-the-start-of-a-dietary-revolution-focused-on-alternative-protein/,2020-02-11,"FMCG Gurus have revealed to us that their research indicates what they call the beginning of a dietary revolution in the US, one focused on alternative protein sources. American consumers, increasingly concerned over their health, are tempted by the increased availability of meat substitutes in fast food outlets amid a mass move away from meat.  The organisation’s consumer research shows that, of those who eat meat regularly, fewer than half say that they have not considered reducing their meat intake. These consumer insights show that there is a move towards meat alternatives and plant-based proteins, even in the diets of those who eat meat. In total, 29% of consumers actively describe themselves as flexitarian. A significant factor is the increased profile of meat alternatives, and the way that manufacturers are aggressively marketing themselves to capture the meat-eating market. Beyond Meat has risen to a market cap of $7.16B  and  Impossible Foods was aiming for a $3-5B valuation at the end of 2019. Roughly a tenth of those who are moving away from meat are being tempted by plant-based alternatives, and with recent launches into major fast-food chains like KFC and Subway, that is likely to rise significantly. It was shown that almost half of those who have reduced their intake suggest that general health concerns are a significant factor with this, with issues about heart health, cancer risks, or digestive health also frequently mentioned. Even without specific concerns, the general perception of meat as a less healthy option leads, by extension, to a level of trust in plant-based products, trust that can be exploited by savvy marketing. This article is based on data from the FMCG Gurus US Meat and Plant-Based Survey, North American Meat Institute, valuation data from NASDAQ and Food Dive, and information from the Impossible Foods Impact Report 2019.

The company first cultivated meat outside of an animal in 2018, and September 2019 announced that it had even created its product at an International Space Station.  The Visitor Centre and Gen-Z Program called ‘Z board’ (for young people born 1995 – 15), is its bid to foster trust and transparency in the new world of cultured meat. Z Board is an advisory board program that is inviting Gen-Z leaders from all continents to be partners in Aleph’s vision of developing a sustainable food system and building a transparent relationship with consumers and young communities. Globally we are seeing a movement of youth urging for climate action, fuelling the demand for sustainability in agriculture leading to a rising interest in cellular agriculture. The launch of Aleph’s educational centre represents the company’s commitment to younger generations who understandably have questions to ask. Co-developed with the Technion Institute of technology, Aleph’s innovation harnesses the power of nature and design to recreate the regenerative capabilities of the cow’s own body by mirroring the regeneration process under controlled conditions and understanding the compositions of meat, the company expertly crafts a thin-cut beef steak– composed of non-GMO cells found in tissues of beef, with a fraction of the resources needed to produce meat using animals. Didier Toubia, Co-Founder and CEO of Aleph Farms stated: “The initiative of launching a visitor centre, came on the heels of substantial demand we’ve been receiving from schools and universities around the world – seeking to visit the facility and meet our team. As a leader in the emerging cultivated meat ecosystem, it is our responsibility to foster a candid dialogue with younger generations. The ‘Z-Board’ provides a unique idea-exchange platform, to make sure Aleph Farms is building the right future for our children”. Contact visitorcenter@aleph-farms.com for further information.

The prize is awarded to five startups each year working on innovative solutions to problems in the pet industry.  The Purina prize, previously awarded to cellular agriculture specialists Bond Pet Foods, comprises $10,000 and the opportunity for business mentorship to help them grow in the industry, as well as participation in a pet care business accelerator boot camp in Purina’s hometown of St. Louis, MO. Because Animals was first launched in December 2016 by Dr. Shannon Falconer and Joshua Errett, MBA. The Because Animals’ science team is working to bring cultured meat pet food to market by 2021, and this recent success will give the company an edge towards breaking into the highly competitive $70 billion U.S. pet care industry. In early 2019, Because Animals successfully created the world’s first cultured meat pet food: namely, they prepared a sample cat treat made from cultured mouse – mice being the ancestral diet of the cat. This achievement attracted the attention of investors (they closed their seed round last October with three high-profile investors), the media and pet food companies such as Purina. Because Animals believes that factory farming has no place in pet nutrition, and as such all Because Animals’ products are made using cultured ingredients including probiotics, nutritional yeast and, most significantly, cultured meat to create nutritious, functional and sustainable pet food.

11902,GFI Predicts Top 5 Alt Protein Trends for 2020,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/gfi-predicts-top-5-alt-protein-trends-for-2020/,2020-01-23,"The Good Food Institute, an organisation which works with scientists, investors, and entrepreneurs and focuses on making clean meat and plant-based alternatives a reality for consumers, has released its top five alt protein predictions for 2020.  The GFI gave some fascinating information to vegconomist last summer indicating that plant products are consistently outperforming their animal counterparts in every category, and also that plant-based meats will soon become more affordable than animal products. The organisation now uses its insight to predict how this year will develop in terms of alt protein. 1. New plant-based and cultivated meat products
“From new breakfast items to plant-based jerky, bacon, and seafood, alternative proteins are now much more than just burgers. Options will continue to expand this year as the demand grows and new players get involved.” “This year, we expect more companies and investors in legacy meat and seafood to capitalize on these growing opportunities and get involved. Expect more investment, more product rollouts, and more truly sustainable seafood in 2020!” 2. Innovative ingredients and enhanced flavors
The GFI thinks that producers will lean towards umami-rich foods in 2020. “I foresee more conventional flavors combined with raw materials that offer the umami flavors and compounds seen in cooked meat,” GFI food scientist MJ Kinney speculates. “That may include fermented plant products, yeast, and various mushrooms.” 3. A growing international market and increasing consumer demand
” Major industry partnerships have brought alternative protein products to more consumers than ever before and will continue to make products more accessible internationally.” GFI senior consumer research scientist Keri Szejda said, “In multiple countries, survey research shows that prior familiarity with plant-based meat is the strongest predictor of purchase intent. Implicit testing indicates that taste is the strongest driver at the actual point of purchase.” 4. More private sector investments and opportunities
GFI business innovation specialist Blake Byrne observes, “In 2019 we strapped a rocket to demand for alternative proteins. In 2020 we will need to do the same, but this time on the supply side. Companies should increasingly focus on building manufacturing capacity and boosting product diversity.” “Commercialization of new plant-based meat production methods like 3D printing, the increased use of microbial fermentation to enhance and produce plant-based foods, and the scaling up of cultivated meat production to at least a pilot scale, are all trends in the space that could attract investors.” 5. A greater need for public sector funding
GFI director of policy Jessica Almy notes, “Last year, both the U.S. House and Senate encouraged research on plant proteins in their agriculture appropriations reports. This year, we hope to see direct allocations of public funds for research that will benefit plant-based and cultivated meat. Publicly funded research will accelerate progress toward a healthy, sustainable, and just food.    "
11905,Noquo Foods Closes a €3.25M Seed Round to “Reinvent Cheese”,https://vegconomist.com/hot-off-the-vegan-press/noquo-foods-closes-a-e3-25m-seed-round-to-reinvent-cheese/,2020-01-23,"Swedish startup Noquo Foods has closed a successful seed round with an impressive list of investors including Northzone (Spotify), Astanor (Infarm, and Ynsect – the largest AgTech investment ever made in Europe), Kale United, and Henry Soesanto (CEO of Monde Nissin, which acquired Quorn).  Other investors participating in the round included Eric Wahlforss (co-founder, Soundcloud), Purple Orange Ventures (Mission Barns, Wild Earth), and others. The young company’s success demonstrates that successful investors with experience from other industries are increasingly starting to invest the alt protein space, which will accelerate the development of the ecosystem. Noquo was founded in early 2019 by Sorosh Tavakoli and Anja Leissner to develop plant-based alternatives to their favourite foods, to include cheese and other dairy products. By European standards and especially for a startup in the field of plant-based dairy alternatives whose products are not yet available on the market, the amount of investment is remarkable. Founder/Managing Director Sorosh Tavakoli had previously founded and managed an online video ad serving technology company, which he sold for approximately $75 million in 2014. Now he wants to build something even bigger with Noquo. It thus shows that entrepreneurs from other industries can also be successful in the field of alternative proteins and drive forward innovative developments in this area.    "
11920,"Alpha Foods: “There’s a Huge Demand for Delicious, Familiar Products in Innovative Formats”",https://vegconomist.com/interviews/alpha-foods-theres-a-huge-demand-for-delicious-familiar-products-in-innovative-formats/,2020-01-21,"  Alpha Foods launched just five years ago and is already widely available across the US. With its approach of using familiar products in innovative formats, plant-based and suited for the grab-and-go/heat-and-eat lifestyle, the company plans to expand beyond the mass grocery channel into more natural channel stores in 2020.  We spoke to Cole Orobetz, Co-Founder of Alpha Foods, about the current portfolio and plans for the future. What is your company’s mission?
Alpha Foods entered the frozen foods category with clear identification of opportunities to elevate and produce flavorful, authentically-textured plant-based products. Alpha Foods’ mission is to deliver smart food choices powered by plants, meeting the needs of grab-and-go/heat-and-eat lifestyles. In addition, an important element part of our mission is to support global benefits of animal welfare, sustainability, and overall health tied to the plant-based industry. Which vegan products do you currently offer? Are there any near term launches planned?
We currently offer a variety of delicious, protein-packed, plant-based alternatives to nostalgic favorites including Alpha Pizzas, Burritos, Handheld Pot Pies, Tamales and more. Our new plant-based chicken line, which includes Chik’n Nuggets, Chik’n Strips and Chik’n Patties, addresses the consumer shift from plant-based beef to plant-based chicken by offering easy, ready-in-minutes ingredients to be used as a foundation to any meal. Additionally, we are slated to launch into the plant-based breakfast space with our Breakfast Burritos, which are anticipated to hit grocery store aisles in the next few months. In which countries do you currently sell in? Which are planned next?
Alpha Foods’ products are available in the United States nationwide at Walmart, Kroger, Albertsons/Safeway, Publix, Sprouts, Whole Foods and various other retailers, as well as online via Mylk Guys (http://mylkguys.com/). Since we started so strong in the mass grocery channel starting in 2017, 2020 will be focused on obtaining placement in more natural channel stores since our products are a perfect fit for those plant-based consumers who are looking for more options from new brands they have yet to try.  As well, our products are perfect for colleges, universities and workplaces, so getting our products into those locations and finding new fans who need quick meal/snack solutions will be on our list. As well, we are moving into 2020 with many more delicious SKUs than we started in 2019 and believe that gaining placement of additional SKUs at the stores we are currently at will help build our brand block and showcase our array of products. There are some other companies active in the vegan ready-to-eat foods market. How do you differentiate yourself against your competitors?
We are unwilling to compromise on great taste and authentic texture in our products, especially in the plant-based chicken arena. With dedication to innovation, our company continuously invests considerable time/resources speaking with consumers to ensure we are developing the most desirable plant-based products that directly address shoppers’ current preferences. Since Alpha Foods’ inception in 2015, our team has been actively engaged in research and development of plant-based proteins and continues to work on advancements in the field, including investigation on alternative protein bases. Where do you see Alpha Foods in 5 years from now?
We would love to see Alpha grab-and-go products around the world to satisfy the consumer cravings for plant-protein products on the go. There is a huge demand for delicious, familiar products in innovative formats and we do feel we have something for everyone’s preference. As well, we would also love to see our Alpha Chik’n Nugget in every QSR [Quick service restaurants] around the world, but will start locally and build out from there. They are truly the best ones around!    "
11922,"Modern Meat: “We Want to Change the Way Food is Produced and Consumed for the Benefit of People, Animals and the Environment”",https://vegconomist.com/interviews/modern-meat-we-want-to-change-the-way-food-is-produced-and-consumed-for-the-benefit-of-people-animals-and-the-environment/,2020-01-17,"Modern Meat is a Vancouver-based alternative protein company that makes 100% vegan, soy, gluten and GMO-free meat alternatives. All products are curated by local chefs who were challenged to create, high protein, nutrient rich, plant-based products with no preservatives, fillers or chemicals.  The company says that its ultimate goal is to provide consumers a healthy alternative to traditional meat without sacrificing taste, and as such the Modern Meat chefs work in kitchens rather than labs and use real, whole food ingredients, with nothing artificial, inspired and dedicated to developing unique tasting recipes for the health-conscious consumer. We spoke with CEO Tara Haddad about the brand and what sets it apart in a crowded marketplace. Please introduce your brand to our readers
At Modern Meat, we are committed to environmental stewardship and animal welfare and recognize that current livestock production is threatening our future.  It is not sustainable to continue producing animals for our consumption. Plant protein is much more efficient to produce than animal protein, therefore we choose to harness that and work with what is sustainable. We desire to reduce our environmental footprint by choosing plant-based products over traditional meat, which requires less water, less land and produces fewer GHG emissions.  Between its resource efficiency and its appeal to consumers, Modern Meat has tremendous potential to help contribute to a sustainable food supply. What was the motivation behind your launch?
The plant-based trend isn’t going anywhere.  While there are more meat alternatives on the market than ever before, we were hard pressed to find one that truly lived up to its claims of being a healthy alternative to meat.  While plant-based, most have high sodium levels, preservatives, chemicals, and a long list of many unfamiliar ingredients. At Modern Meat, we choose to create authentic products, ones that you can feel good about eating.  Modern Meat was born out of a desire to offer consumers delicious, gourmet products that are nutrient rich, high in protein from plants and made from simple, whole food ingredients.  We want people to enjoy and feel good about what they are eating which is why we remain steadfast in constantly refining our recipes until we’ve reached that sweet spot of deliciousness and nutritiousness. Please describe your current range.
There seems to be no niche for this product.  Everyone from vegans, vegetarians and flexitarians can enjoy Modern Meat. There is a developing interest from the typical carnivore, who are making conscious decisions due to health concerns to cut back on meat and incorporate more plant-based foods in their diets.  They do not want to sacrifice on taste and still want the same pleasure they get from eating a traditional meat product. Accordingly, Modern Meat works hard to deliver products that mimic the texture and taste of their meat counterparts.  For example, our Modern Burger has the look and appearance of a conventional burger however the ingredients are made up entirely of vegetables and spices. It even provides the same amount of protein you would get from a meat burger but with less than half the fat. What is your market positioning / USP?
Modern Meat provides plant-based products that are a healthier more sustainable alternative to traditional meat.  We are deliberate in choosing soy-free, gluten-free and non-GMO ingredients.  At Modern Meat, we want to change the way food is produced and consumed for the benefit of people, animals and the environment.  It’s about feeding a growing number of people the protein they want in ways that are sustainable. Do you have any latest innovations or developments in progress which you can share with us?
Our goal is to introduce new products to consumers each quarter throughout the year.  Our Development Chefs are continually working to develop new plant-based food items and go through many renditions before the final recipe is perfected.  It’s a challenging task and our aim is to always ensure a flavourful taste profile that is high in protein and low in fat. In which countries do you have a presence, and do you plan to expand to other markets?
We currently have a presence in BC, Canada and wish to extend across the country and to the US market in 2020. Who are your current retail partners/ online sales?
Modern Meat is currently available in food service and will be launching into retail once we finalize the certifications that are pending. We will roll our on-line sales platform in April 2020. Plans for 2020?
As a start-up company we have many near and long-term goals to achieve. For 2020, we want to expand our food service business and be production-ready when we launch into retail mid-year. We have many products in the R&D and testing stages in the hands of our masterful chefs. Their innovation is what moves us forward as we continue to move the needle on healthy meat alternative products.    "

We can’t wait to share tasty, sustainable cultivated meat with avid meat eaters.” AJ Plotkin, Partner at ff Venture Capital, said: “As a firm we focus on transformative technologies and visionary founders. We’ve found that in Brian and the team at New Age Meats. We are confident cultivated meat will be part of the food economy long term.”    "
12003,"The German Institute of Food Technology (DIL): “In Principle, Microalgae Could be Used in all Processed Foods”",https://vegconomist.com/interviews/the-german-institute-of-food-technology-dil-in-principle-microalgae-could-be-used-in-all-processed-foods/,2019-12-19,"On 07 November 2019 the kick-off meeting for the EU project “Pro-Future” took place in Barcelona. The international research project deals with microalgae as protein-rich ingredients for future food and feed. The aim is to develop more efficient production and processing concepts to integrate high-quality, safe, healthy and sustainable products and ingredients into the food value chain.  DIL (Deutsches Institut für Lebensmitteltechnik e.V) participates in the international community with 31 partners and generates 559,500 euros for research in Quakenbrück, Lower Saxony. We spoke with Dr. Marie-Christin Baun, who studied plant biotechnology at Leibniz University in Hannover. She successfully completed her doctorate in molecular plant physiology in 2017 investigates the properties and possible applications of plant-derived proteins in food at DIL. What exactly is the microalgae project about?
The increasing world population is leading to a higher demand for healthy food and high-quality protein sources such as meat, dairy products, eggs and pulses. However, our farmland is limited and protein production from conventional sources is limited by technical and environmental factors. The project “Pro Future” deals with the development of microalgae as an alternative protein source for food and feed, focusing on the efficiency and sustainability of algae cultivation, protein production and its processing into food and feed. The entire supply chain will be considered and optimised so that minimising land, water and energy use and maximising efficiency as well as the use of side streams are overarching objectives. In addition, possible applications of the obtained algae and algae proteins in food and feed will be investigated in more detail. For example, proteins can have a stabilizing function in food, like gluten which ensures that a structuring network is formed when a dough is baked. The addition of algae and algae proteins may therefore greatly alter the structure and taste of food. All these effects need to be explored so that healthy and tasty food can be produced in the end. Additionally, consumers are to be involved in product development as concerns need to be clarified, and awareness and acceptance for algae and algae-containing foods in the population shall be created so that algae can represent a promising protein source in the future. Which plant-based products can be made from microalgae?
In principle, microalgae could be used in all processed foods. However, it depends on whether they are only added as a taste component or whether they should perform a certain function. To what extent algae proteins can take over certain functions in food and thus replace, for example, chemical additives or other ingredients needs to be clarified in “Pro Future”. The project will cover a wide range of vegan products, e.g. bread, pasta, sausages and protein shakes. The development is carried out in cooperation with companies that want to subsequently introduce these products to the market.  Which beneficial properties do microalgae have as a protein source?
Microalgae have a high photosynthesis efficiency, i.e. they can produce oxygen and sugar from solar energy, water and CO2 just like plants on land. Compared to plants, however, they have higher growth rates and thus a higher yield (50-80 tons per hectare per year). Another big advantage is that microalgae are not competing with other plants or animals for agricultural land, as they can be grown in artificial or natural ponds and, in the case of marine algae, directly in the sea. Microalgae have a protein content of 30-60 %. This is highly dependent on the type of algae but can be significantly higher than the protein content in skimmed milk powder (36%), soy meal (37%), chicken meat (24%), fish (24%) or peanuts (26%). While certain essential amino acids, i.e. amino acids which our body cannot produce itself but which are important for our metabolism, are often limited in plant proteins, microalgae show a very balanced amino acid profile. Furthermore, microalgae are rich in vitamins, antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids. Could animal stables be converted into production facilities for microalgae?
The conversion of animal stables into microalgae production plants is certainly feasible. But in my opinion it misses the goal of sustainability because in a closed facility artificial light would be required to enable the algae to photosynthesise. This would require additional electrical energy. However, it is imaginable to operate microalgae farms with waste heat and CO2-rich exhaust air from stables, large factories or power plants.    "
12016,Enormous Plantbased Growth in 2019 for Rügenwalder Mühle,https://vegconomist.com/business-insiders/enormous-plantbased-growth-in-2019-for-rugenwalder-muhle/,2019-12-18,"In a guest article for vegconomist, Godo Röben, Managing Director of Rügenwalder Mühle, outlines the company’s view of the year 2019. The German food manufacturer produces both meat and meat alternatives, and has operated in the plantbased market for around five years. The company increased its revenue 2018 to EUR 212 million, thanks to the trend for plantbased products in Europe.  Godo Röben: “We are very satisfied with 2019 – for almost exactly one year, the vegetarian and vegan market picked up momentum again. The growth is tremendous: at the beginning of the year, we started with a 20% growth rate; currently we are above 40%. And for the last weeks of the year we are expecting growth rates of 70 to 80%; and this despite the fact that we have already achieved a mid-double-digit million euro turnover with vegetarian and vegan products last year. The growth does not only apply to us, but the market for alternative proteins as a whole. Ever new distribution channels such as system catering or canteens follow; more and more start-ups, corporations and SMEs jump on the train, even from the meat and sausage industry. And besides meat alternatives, more and more alternatives to fish and cheese are now becoming subject on manufacturers’ agendas. However, the strong growth increasingly leads to bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials. But there is also a lot going on there: In the raw materials sector, our efforts to source more from Europe and Germany – instead of from North America – are becoming increasingly successful. We have already achieved to source about a 50% share for soya from Europe. Furthermore, we also are getting more and more offers and requests from local farmers who want to grow alternative proteins here on-site. We are providing high-level support to these projects, but there is still a lot to do in research, too. The topic “regional raw materials” is definitely on our agenda in 2020. In addition, we will start a new product group in 2020: in addition to fresh meat, vegetarian and vegan alternatives with a shelf-life of around 10 days will be available in the chest chillers in the ultra-fresh segment. Here, even less additives are needed in production and the fresh products can be used in many different ways, much like raw minced meat. So, the future seems to look bright. However, young markets can always encounter “turbulences”. This has already become visible on the German market for alternative sources of protein in the past: following an incredible start in 2015/2016, there was stagnation until 2018, and we have seen a market shakeout.  Since 2018, we record great growths and consultants like AT Kearney and JP Morgan predict a US-$ 100-400 billion market over the next 10 years. In the long and medium term, and despite normal turbulences, there will be a continued growth.    "
12038,Because Animals: “Cultured Meat Provides a Safer and More Nutritious Alternative to Pet Food”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/because-animals-cultured-meat-provides-a-safer-and-more-nutritious-alternative-to-pet-food/,2019-12-12,"While Because Animals founder Dr Shannon Falconer was a microbiologist at Stanford University, she met Joshua Errett  who was earning his MBA from Indiana University. Together the two wanted to find a solution to a problem facing both of them and many vegans today: how do we feed our pets without harming other animals or the environment?  The answer was, “Because Animals”, and thus the company and its name were born. We spoke with Dr Shannon about their product and about the notion of cultured meat in the pet food category. Please introduce your brand to our readers.
We are Because Animals, The Cultured Pet Food Company. The “cultured” element of our name represents the core cultured ingredients in each of our products: probiotics, nutritional yeast, and our marquee offering, cultured meat. None of our products are made with animals as our mission is to create nutritious, sustainable pet food without inflicting harm on other animals or the planet. Why cultured meat, and why for pets?
More than a quarter of the environmental effects of factory farming are directly attributable to pet food. Factory farming is also a cruel and inhumane practice and we believe it has no place in pet nutrition. In contrast to animal-grown meat, culture-grown meat — or cultured meat — is meat grown without raising or slaughtering animals. It is grown in a way that is similar to an embryo developing in the womb, except that cultured meat begins with a small collection of animal cells that are grown in a nutrient-rich environment outside the animal. Cultured meat has the same nutritional value and composition as animal­-based meat. It is, in fact, meat. Though in contrast to traditional meat, our cultured meat is grown without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones; and without animal suffering and slaughter. And it doesn’t cause environmental damage. Additionally, cultured meat provides a safer and more nutritious alternative to pet food made with animal-grown meat. For example, every year, the Food and Drug Administration issues recalls on pet food for reasons that include contamination by the animal euthanizing agent, pentobarbital. What specific kind of cultured pet meat are you going to produce, and for which kind of animals?
Earlier this year we successfully created the world’s first cultured meat pet food. Namely, we prepared a cat treat made from cultured mouse, mice being the ancestral diet of the cat. In addition to treats, we’re developing nutritionally complete foods for both cats and dogs. In terms of the variety of cultured meat we’re creating, we have some exciting announcements in the future so stay tuned! What are the biggest challenges?
Scaling! Transitioning from bench to pilot to commercial scale is tough and it’s a challenge that every cultured meat company is facing. Consumer acceptance: How will you convince pet owners to change from real meat to cultured meat?
Cultured meat is real meat, and our biggest challenge will be communicating to the public why this is the case. Animal-grown meat and cultured-meat are indeed very different (as discussed above), but from a nutritional perspective both products are meat. All of that said, we understand this is a very new concept to wrap one’s head around. That’s why we are introducing pet products — such as our supplement and dog cookie — containing more conventional cultured ingredients, such as probiotics and nutritional yeast. This eases the customer into the world of cultured foods with ingredients they’re already familiar with. Everything we communicate to our audience, from social media, to newsletters and press releases, is done with the objective of being transparent and honest about our creation of cultured meat. It’s so important for us that we bring customers along the journey with us, and that they understand and feel completely comfortable with our process. And, thankfully, there are many companies helping to pave the way. Growth in the plant-based meat sector has been substantial to say the least. And their collective mission is the same as ours: the status quo in animal agriculture isn’t sustainable and the planet urgently needs companies like ours to find alternatives. There are also about 35 other cultured meat startups speaking to consumers in similar ways. Do you already have any information on pricings?
Customers can expect to pay the same price for our cultured meat pet food products as they’re currently spending on other premium pet food items. Are you looking for investors?
We’re thrilled to say that we recently closed our Seed Round of investment. So, although we’re not actively looking for investment at this moment, we will be opening up our Series A in the summer of 2020. We love to build a strong relationship with our investors, so conversations can never start too early. When do you expect your products to enter retail?
We’re aiming for a limited-release launch of our cultured meat cat treat in early/mid 2021. What are your plans for the next few years?
Developing cultured meat pet foods is not something that will stop after releasing our first cultured mouse cat treat. We have big plans! Customers can expect some exciting new products from us over the next several years.    "

The cultured meat company says that with new technology it will be able to cultivate its product at scale and should be ready to launch in summer of 2020.  The recent investment arrives primarily from pre-existing investors and with participation from Taavet Hinrikus, founding CEO of TransferWise, and Albert Wenger, of Union Square Ventures. Meatable founder Krijn de Nood says that a portion of the funds were provided by the European Commission through its Eurostars Programme, which indicates to him that the EU is now seriously acknowledging the potential of cultured meat in addressing climate change. de Nood stated, “We’re excited to announce this new funding, which will enable us to expand our scaling and cost reduction teams. No one should have to give up the meat they love – there is a way to satisfy the world’s appetite for meat without harming people, animals or the planet. “The new funds will enable us to make significant strides toward fulfilling our mission, as they will be instrumental as for expanding our cost-reduction and scaling teams. They will enable us to accelerate the development of our beef and pork cells and, importantly, our process for forming whole cuts of meat. We expect to unveil our first prototype this summer.”    "
12061,IDTechEx Forecasts Plant-Based and Cultured Meat Growth 2020 – 2030,https://vegconomist.com/studies-and-numbers/idtechex-forecasts-plant-based-and-cultured-meat-growth-2020-2030/,2019-12-06,"A report recently compiled by IDTechEx forecasting plant-based and cultured meat growth for 2020 – 2030, has outlined the need for meat alternatives as the human population outgrows the sustainability of current animal farming.  The report predicts that the human population could reach 10 billion by the year 2050 and also that meat sales are not declining, despite the rise in veganism and the current global reaction to climate change; the recent surge in investments and production of plant-based meat alternatives is not enough to make the change needed for human food to be sustainable. Cellular agriculture, or ‘cultured meat’, has the potential to produce meat products identical to those produced through animal slaughter, far more efficiently and at a fraction of the environmental cost. It also offers more appeal to the many who will not give up meat. Cultured meat startups have raised over $125 million since 2015 and investment grew by 85% between 2017 and 2018.  Pioneering Dutch start-up Mosa Meats claims that a single cell sample can create up to 10,000 kg of cultured meat, with the production process requiring 99% less land and 96% less water than traditional livestock agriculture. IDTechEx states that both industries still have a long way to go before they can threaten the global meat industry. Despite rapid growth, plant-based meat still has less than 1% market share of the US meat industry.    "
12063,Positioning PHW as a Supplier of High-Quality Alternative Protein products,https://vegconomist.com/business-insiders/positioning-phw-as-a-supplier-of-high-quality-alternative-protein-products/,2019-12-06,"Marcus Keitzer was appointed by PHW Group in 2018 as board member for alternative proteins to lead the company’s Alternative Protein Business Unit.    2019 was an exciting and challenging year for our newly founded business division of alternative proteins. In Q1, we presented the second generation of protein products together with Beyond Meat and JUST at the INTERNORGA. Starting in June, the Beyond Burger was available in stores. Our customers’ feedback excites us, and we are very satisfied with the product’s listing. Currently we are working on the launch of the Beyond Sausage. In the summer, we announced our distribution partnership with AIXA Trade, which has brought the first vegan mozzarella to market. The product will be available in spring of 2020. There is also news regarding our own vegan products: Since July, our Veggie Bologna has been free of soy, which is viewed more and more critically. Its main ingredients are now pea and potato protein. Going forward, it is our goal to increasingly position ourselves as a supplier of high-quality protein products, always based on our current and future core business field ‘poultry’. Our strategy in the segment of alternative proteins is primarily based on a ‘three-pillar-structure’: Establishing our own product portfolio, targeted investments in suitable businesses and distribution partnerships. We are certainly in the beginning stages, but we have occupied several topics – from alternatives to meat, fish and eggs to insects – and will continue to do so in the coming years. I am proud that we could strengthen our portfolio of protein products. These products don’t target only the vegan audience. The new generation of vegan products creates a taste experience that comes very close to the original. Appearance, texture, the products’ bite and the preparation experience are nearly identical. This makes the products interesting for flexitarians, who view them as an alternative to meat, thereby creating enormous market potential. If the product is tasty, the customers are more than willing to consume it in addition to meat. The taste is the critical aspect for the success. The high amount of attention for this new generation of plant-based products helps the entire market, which is a pleasant development. In the future, plant-based alternatives will have a significant market share. Because capital increasingly flows into the development of plant-based products, it is also to be expected that further interesting, good products with high consumer acceptance will make it to market.

Employing the same fermentation technology that is used to produce ingredients for cheese making or insulin for diabetics, Bond adjusts the process to instead harvest high-quality meat proteins like chicken, turkey, beef, pork and fish, but without the animal. In February of this year the company was selected by Nestle Purina as finalists for their 2019 innovation prize. The Seed round is led by Lever VC, a venture capital fund specializing in alternative protein investments, with Agronomics, KBW Ventures, Plug and Play Ventures, Andante Asset Management and others participating. “What makes us so excited about Bond Pet Foods is that it’s the first clean-meat company producing meat protein in a way that doesn’t require major technological breakthroughs to get to price parity with conventional meat,” said Nick Cooney, Founder and Managing Partner at Lever VC. “We don’t think there’s any other company out there with the potential to disrupt the $100 billion pet food market as much as Bond Pet Foods.” This round of funding will be instrumental in driving the research and development needed to develop and scale Bond’s animal protein production and to debut its first consumer product early next year, a protein-packed dog treat bar made with a pure yeast protein. It also serves as an important first step in elevating the use of ingredients made through microbial fermentation in pet food, and educating the public about its merits. In an interview with vegconomist last year, CEO Rich Kelleman said that pet food, “like people food, is moving towards a healthier, more humane, sustainable reality. We will be at the forefront of this pursuit in the pet category.” Click here to read his insightful opinion piece about the pet food industry.    "

12153,New Food Conference 2020: “New Proteins are the Key to a More Sustainable Food System”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/new-food-conference-2020-new-proteins-are-the-key-to-a-more-sustainable-food-system/,2019-11-15,"More and more companies are investing time and resources in developing strategies to satisfy the growing demand for meat, fish, and dairy without putting further strain on the planet’s limited resources. From young startups to major players, innovation and sustainability are crucial topics for everyone involved in the food sector.In addition to startups and established players, the full spectrum of food-industry stakeholders will once again come together at the New Food Conference in Berlin in 2020, from 23-24 April, to discuss the latest developments in alternative protein sources. The first edition of the event took place earlier this year, with the conference now being expanded due to the remarkable response from delegates. We spoke with Katleen Haefele, Head of Food Services and Events at ProVeg, who explained what people can expect at next year’s New Food Conference. What makes the New Food Conference different?
The New Food Conference 2019 was the first event of its kind in Europe, serving as a platform to discuss the future of both cell- and plant-based proteins. The conference reaches out to stakeholders all along the food value chain and thus covers a broad range of topics. We’ve received especially great feedback for the depth of content and the relevance of the issues discussed. We also draw a very international crowd: in the first year, we welcomed delegates from 32 countries. The conference is attractive to a high-profile audience, and offers unique networking possibilities.  The New Food Conference 2020 will take place in the Bolle Event Venue in Berlin. Why did you decide to move?
The first edition of the event was a great success, which is why we decided to expand the conference in its second year. The market is shifting and we have observed a crucial need for this kind of event. Numerous of plant-based innovations have already successfully entered the market, and many others are lining up. It’s essential to offer them a platform, to connect the multiple stakeholders in the food industry, and to continue to push pioneering food solutions such as these. Not only does the Bolle Event Venue offer room for more guests and exhibitors, but, as a former dairy plant, it is the perfect location to showcase the ongoing transformation of the food industry. What new features can delegates look forward to?
We will be spicing up the New Food Conference 2020 with fresh presentation formats. In addition to classic stand-alone speaker slots and panel discussions, we will break down some of the latest advancements in short, captivating TED-style talks. Additionally, our keynote speakers have agreed to be interviewed in a couple of fireside chats, which means that there will be opportunities to bring up novel questions. In general, the whole event will be highly interactive: a customised event app will allow for better Q&A sessions and enable even better networking opportunities for delegates. We are also excited to tell you that we have just launched a fresh new website. Who is the event targeted at?
The New Food Conference will address topics across the entire food value chain and will attract international stakeholders, ranging from ingredient suppliers and producers to retail and food service experts. New protein has the potential to open up vast new markets, which makes this event particularly important for startups and investors. Entrepreneurs account for the largest share of our audience, side by side with representatives from scientific fields, the media, and NGOs. We are in the midst of shaping a high-value programme for next year and can already confirm Caroline Zimmer (Simply V), Mark Post (Mosa Meat), and Will Schafer (Beyond Meat) as speakers – and will be adding additional high-profile representatives over the next few months. Who are the partners of the New Food Conference 2020?
We are excited to announce that this year’s partners, Rügenwalder Mühle and Simply V, have once again confirmed their platinum-level support, along with Döhler, who were also involved in this year’s edition. Hydrosol, Avebe, and Good Seed Ventures, all previous supporters, have not only confirmed their continued sponsorships, but have upgraded their packages. This enthusiastic response speaks to the quality and professional implementation of the event, as well as to the strong relevance of the topics for leading businesses. We are also thrilled to welcome Beyond Meat, Lidl, Vemag, and Handtmann as new partners, and we will continue to engage with additional potential partners and sponsors. What are some ways to get involved with the New Food Conference?
We are still looking for innovative companies who would like to partner or contribute to the conference. I suggest that any company which targets leading food-industry stakeholders should take a look at our new website. There are various ways to get involved, each suitable for different needs and budgets.

12183,"Loui Blake: “Our Marketing Strategy Has Driven Customers, and the Product Has Kept Them Coming Back”",https://vegconomist.com/interviews/loui-blake-our-marketing-strategy-has-driven-customers-and-the-product-has-kept-them-coming-back/,2019-11-11,"Loui Blake is a successful vegan entrepreneur who owns and operates Erpingham House – the UK’s largest plant-based restaurant. He also runs Kalifornia Kitchen in London and has recently completed a crowdfund to open a second restaurant location in Brighton, just 18 months after launching the first.  We spoke with Loui ahead of his speech at Vevolution Festival which takes place next Saturday 16th November at London’s BFI Southbank. Please introduce yourself and tell our readers your role in the vegan business world.
I’m Loui Blake, co-founder of Erpingham House, which is the UK’s largest vegan restaurant located in Norwich (and soon to open in Brighton!) I also own Kalifornia Kitchen, a vegan restaurant in central London, amongst other ventures. I speak regularly on veganism and business and have just launched the plant-based business podcast in collaboration with Vevolution. How has the vegan scene changed and progressed over the past few years and what do you see as the main factors behind this progress?
I went vegan in 2015. At this time, not many people knew what veganism was, and I certainly didn’t know any vegans! There were very few options in mainstream restaurants and I was hard-pressed to find anyone online that I could relate to. Fast forward to today and it’s seemingly everywhere! The rate of growth in the UK is phenomenal, which I largely feel is down to the internet and the steady availability of information. Recent movies on Netflix like What the Health and The Game Changers have driven greater numbers to trying it, which I think is brilliant. How do you attribute the success of your restaurant Erpingham House which has been so popular in its first year?
We’ve very clearly communicated why we exist, and what we’re trying to achieve. In doing this, we’re able to meet people where they are. We’ve also been open to pivoting when things aren’t working and trying new things, with a willingness to fail and an open dialogue with customers to know what they like and what they don’t. Knowing that the vegan community, although growing, isn’t big enough alone to support a restaurant of this size, we’ve had to find ways to appeal to consumers who don’t regard themselves as vegan per say, but are open to healthy, sustainable & delicious food. Our marketing strategy has driven customers, and the product has kept them coming back. This is down to cultivating an incredibly talented team, who are all aligned with our mission and have helped to create the business as it is today. What makes a successful plant-based restaurant, in your opinion?
I think that in order to be successful as a plant-based restaurant, ultimately your product has to be excellent. People have access to so much choice and are seemingly more difficult to please than ever, so it’s important to have a great product. Secondly, and equally important, is to let people know that you exist. You need to go where people’s attention is and offer them value. What are the most noticeable and interesting trends in plant-based dining at the moment, in the UK or in general?
There’s a growing trend in alternative proteins, which I think is great to help people replicate tastes from animal proteins without the need to eat them, but personally I’m a predominantly clean eater. Therefore, owing to my personal bias, I’m really enjoying seeing more plant-based meat alternatives reach the market. Jackfruit is growing in popularity but watch out for other exotic fruits & vegetables to reach our plates. Equally, I’m excited to see more fine-dining style restaurants offer plant-based meals & concepts. The luxury market is important for veganism, as this is where the capital is and can help spread the message further. Tell us about your association with Vevolution and how you will be involved in November’s Vevolution Festival?
I met Co-Founder Judy on Twitter back in 2015, when she was probably the first vegan I had met. I had a recruitment company at the time, and we helped provide some staff for the event, but through a conversation she asked if I would speak on a panel about entrepreneurship. The talk went really well (I think I hogged the mic a little) and they’ve asked me to speak at every event since! I’ve also launched the plant-based business podcast with Judy & Co-founder Damien recently, which is a real passion project of ours. They’re amazing, and doing such a great job with Vevolution, so I try to support them as best I can. What advice would you have to new entrepreneurs or anyone wanting to invest in vegan business right now?
Focus on providing creative solutions to problems, ensure you have a model that can provide value to all parties, but still allows you to make a profit to spread your message. Anything else you would like to add?
Erpingham House will be opening on January 2020 in Brighton. Stay tuned for opening date!    "

The book discusses the myriad benefits of alternative proteins from plants, fungi, and cell-based meat products, created sustainably and with a fraction of the environmental impact caused by animal agriculture. Authored by Wild Earth’s CEO and founder Ryan Bethencourt, an expert in biotechnology, together with veterinary scientist Dr. Ernie Ward, and animal welfare expert Alice Oven – The Clean Pet Food Revolution: How Better Pet Food Will Change the World, challenges conventional myths and explains the science behind what we feed our pets and the impact it has on the environment. “The fact is, the marketing line that ‘dogs crave meat’ is completely unsupported by science, and frankly, has potentially ruinous effects on the health of our pets,” said Dr. Ward. “The public has been fed a steady diet of misinformation for years, leading to the false belief that a pet’s diet must be based in animal proteins. We’ve shown that to be utterly false.” “The scientific developments in both human and animal nutrition have made it clear that alternative protein sources have all but eliminated the conventional belief that the only healthy protein is a meat protein,” said Ryan Bethencourt of Wild Earth, a vegan pet food company. “Sustainable, non-meat-based proteins are as healthy for our animals — and ourselves — as meat-based proteins, without the devastating effects on the environment. The time is now for a revolution in the pet food industry, we can’t afford to wait any longer.”    "

Founded in 2018, Future Meat Technologies calls itself a pioneer in the cost-efficient, GMO-free production of meat directly from animal cells, without the need to raise or harvest animals. The company has a highly sustainable manufacturing model resulting in 99% less land use and 80% less greenhouse gas emissions than traditional meat. Funding will be used to expand R&D efforts and build the world’s first cultured meat pilot production facility, estimated to begin operations in 2020, south of Tel Aviv. “With this investment, we’re thrilled to bring cultured meat from the lab to the factory floor and begin working with our industrial partners to bring our product to market,” said Rom Kshuk, CEO of Future Meat Technologies. “We’re not only developing a global network of investors and advisors with expertise across the meat and ingredient supply chains, but also providing the company with sufficient runway to achieve commercially viable production costs within the next two years.” Future Meat Technologies’ groundbreaking process utilizes the rapid growth of connective tissue cells, called fibroblasts, to reach high densities before turning the cells to cultured muscle and healthy fats. The company aims to introduce hybrid products – combining plant proteins for texture and cultured fats that create the distinct aroma and flavor of meat. “I personally want to make sure my children and grandchildren will be able to enjoy the same meat dishes that I grew up with. The worldwide demand for protein is growing exponentially, and the only way to meet this demand is by fundamentally reinventing animal agriculture. Future Meat Technologies created a cost-effective solution for cultured meat manufacturing that is scalable and sustainable by design,” noted Prof. Yaakov Nahmias, the company’s founder and Chief Scientist. This Series A funding marks the second largest investment round in the cultured meat sector to date, indicating significant interest from the financial community in the entire meat market – amid growing demand for sustainability in the face of deforestation and climate change.

We were very positively surprised how many vegan products were presented there. Beyond Meat, JUST and Moving Mountains were presented by their respective distributors, PHW and Zandbergen, in the middle of the meat halls – which took some getting used to for vegans.  Vegan products were also available in practically all of the more than ten halls through which crowds of visitors passed. Fry’s from South Africa presented a new vegan pizza. Planted, a spin-off of ETH Zurich (University) from Switzerland, presented really tasty new meat substitutes. Planty of Meat from Bavaria came up with a delicious sunflower based burger. Viva Maris from Germany convinced us with delicious algae products. There were also many other companies and start-ups from all over the world. The supporting programme was also impressive. The iFood conference focused on the major food trends. There we were able to talk to Didier Toubia about Aleph Farms. Two floors down at the ANUGA Horizn2050 special event on Monday, alternative proteins were the focus all day long. Representatives from investors such as BlueHorizon, Beyond Meat and A. T. Kearney spoke about the alternative nutrition of the future. In the corridors we met again and again faces from the vegan industry, entrepreneurs, representatives of NGOs and even from German politics, who want to pay more attention to the topic of alternative proteins in the future. Despite all the enthusiasm, however, we have to keep our feet on the ground. Compared to the massive offer of conventional food suppliers, vegan offers were in the absolute minority.    "
12343,Two Thirds of Americans Are Purchasing Meat Alternatives,https://vegconomist.com/studies-and-numbers/two-thirds-of-americans-are-purchasing-meat-alternatives/,2019-10-02,"According to consumer research recently conducted by Innova Market Insights, around two thirds of consumers in the US say that they are purchasing meat alternatives, with 22% doing so on rare occasions, 10% saying that they always buy meat alternatives, and 36% doing so often or sometimes.  As we reported last month, another study showed that almost half (48%) of consumers who purchased meat alternatives were meat-eaters, as we see more and more plantbased products aimed towards the flexitarian market, offering realistic meat-like taste and texture. Lu Ann Williams, Director of Innovation at Innova Market Insights, said, “Meat substitutes should now carry the right messages for both healthful and mindful customers, with plant-based diets emerging as the epitome of guilt free eating.”  The Innova research demonstrates that manufacturers of new products in the category are acknowledging vegans, with almost three-quarters of new meat alternative products launched last year in the US being suitable for vegan consumers. However it is increasingly clear that the growing flexitarian group is the priority in terms of marketing. Nielsen released data this August related to the rise of meat alternatives, the findings of which demonstrated that the average American consumer today is an omnivore interested in alternative proteins. The study, named “Meet the New Meat Eater, showed that 98% of meat alternative buyers in America also purchase meat products, 61% of those surveyed say they would reduce their meat consumption, and 43% would replace meat-based protein with plant-based protein alternatives.

Reportedly, the initiative has been launched in response to urgent challenges “faced by the planet, including climate change and global food security.”  A range of innovative new-protein foods made from plants, fungi, byproducts, and residues will soon emerge from Smart Protein, a new Horizon 2020 project funded by the European Commission. The primary aim of the project, as described in a press release, is to “help build a future-proof protein supply by creating sustainable and nutritious alternative proteins.”  Smart Protein has a total budget of €9.6 million, €8.2 million from the European Commission, and will run for four years from 1 January 2020. The project is based on the key findings from the previous Horizon 2020 project, PROTEIN2FOOD. Both projects emerged from The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States, which established judicial obligations to rethink our food systems. The first products are said to include plant-based meats, fish, seafood, cheese, infant formula, and other dairy products, as well as baked goods, and will go to market in or around 2025. New plantbased products will be developed from fava beans, lentils, chickpeas, and quinoa, with investigations into cost-effective protein extraction, protein chemistry, polymeric structure, physicochemical behaviour, and protein-protein interaction in order to maximise the functionality of these proteins in food and drinks.  Emanuele Zannini, Senior Research Officer with the University of Cork and the Lead Coordinator of Smart Protein, said: “With the Smart Protein project, we are reconsidering the entire protein value chain from production to consumption in terms of both productive and environmental performance.  We are also targeting soil-health restoration through organic regenerative agriculture practices that are able to shift from carbon-source to carbon-sink agriculture, which is more resilient to the effects of climate change and helps farmers’ long-term financial futures.” Smart Protein’s approach and strategy will focus on byproducts and residues, ingredients that are usually used for animal feed. Microbial biomass proteins will be created from edible fungi by up-cycling byproducts from pasta (pasta residues), bread (bread crusts), and beer (spent yeast and malting rootlets).      "

The organisation states, “The relationship between consumers and their food is changing. Manufacturers are adapting to this change to provide products that are tailored to consumers’ ever-changing lifestyles and values.” In terms of the rise of plant-based diets around the planet, the report says that “meat analogues have taken the lead among alternative proteins” and says that lab cultured meat is a prospect which “looms” but that it faces significant challenges, for example in terms of cost and public acceptance.  Next month will see the 2019 Anuga trade fair in take place Cologne, with a focus on “Alternative Proteins – New Sources to Feed 10 Billion” which will discuss plant solutions, cell-based meat and fish cultures, and other protein sources.

The Keto Zoodle Bowl served with Beyond Meatballs is replacing the popular Smokehouse Steak Salad. The vegan meatballs can also be ordered with any salad, wrap, or warm bowl.  “The future of food is plant-based,” said Janani Lee, Just Salad’s Chief Sustainability Officer in a statement. “We’re thrilled to offer our guests an alternative to beef that’s just as delicious yet significantly more eco-friendly. She added, “We know red meat’s incredibly wasteful and has a huge carbon footprint, so we decided to remove grass-fed steak from our menu and replace that with Beyond Meat.” With the promise to choose the planet or profit, this is another effort by the company to advocate for improved food sustainability. It was one of the first fast-casual chains to introduce reusable bowls. Earlier this year, the company announced its Green Standard sustainability initiative which includes replacing plastic containers with biodegradable fiber bowls by the end of the year. The goal is to become a zero-waste restaurant by 2025. It has also developed a composting program and participates in the NYC Carbon Challenge.  Though there are a growing number of plant-based protein options, Just Salad chose Beyond Meat for its clean ingredients and consistent supply.  “We spent a lot of time weighing different plant-based options for our menu, and Beyond simply offers the most versatile and best-tasting product out there,” Lee explained. “Our R&D team made a number of recipes using ground Beyond Beef and conducted company-wide taste tests and small consumer focus groups. We all loved the Beyond Beef meatball recipe and were excited by the endless culinary opportunities with Beyond Beef.” Following the announcement to ditch beef, Lee told Forbes: “This move isn’t about winning guests, it’s about doing what we think is right as a company. We know that some of our steak-loving guests might be disappointed, but we hope they can appreciate our concerns around beef’s environmental impact and are willing to explore our alternative protein options.”  She added: “We also believe this is part of a new movement in environmental responsibility. We serve over 30,000 people a day, so we have the potential to make a real difference in people’s lives and their overall carbon footprint.”     "

The latest funding round will support further deals – a number of which are already underway – as well as the development of Kale United’s ecosystem of shared services designed to support the growth of member companies. Most recently, Kale United invested in German plant-based food brand Veganz, and is exploring synergies with this and other investments. Kale United founder Måns Ullerstam said: “This is an amazing time for the global plant-based movement, with highly innovative start-ups that are solving some of our planet’s biggest challenges attracting strong interest from an increasingly diverse pool of investors. We’re seeing interest from traditional impact investors that have previously backed sustainability initiatives, amid growing recognition that plant-based companies directly address many UN Sustainable Development Goals, and will play a significant role in improving the health of our planet and its population in the future. “Companies like Hooray Foods, Baihu Foods, Peace of Meat, FUMI Ingredient, Good Dot or Boon Bonen are just a snapshot of the next wave of brands heading for the mainstream. We are also seeing strong growth in the alternative protein sector – there’s not only plant-based, cell-based, algae-based and fungi-based protein, but now also, incredibly, even air-based protein! Now, many clean meat initiatives are not just R&D concepts, they are fast becoming a commercial reality – and Kale United is watching closely, we are keen to back such initiatives. Kale United now has more than 300 investors from over 30 countries including China, India and Brazil. We are proud to be uniting a community that believes in a better future with brands who are striving to make this a reality.

The economic modelling was commissioned by Food Frontier, Australia and New Zealand’s think tank for alternative proteins, and conducted by Deloitte Access Economics. It demonstrates that, at present, the Australian plant-based meat sector brings around $30 million to the economy and supports 265 jobs. However, by 2030 it is projected to grow to between $398 million and almost $3 billion a year in economic value and between $1.4 billion and $4.6 billion in consumer expenditure. Under the “moderate” scenario, the sector is expected to generate $1.1 billion in economic value, almost $3 billion in consumer expenditure, and employ more than 6000 full-time employees. “Put simply, we’re facing a multi-billion-dollar opportunity for Australia to become a global plant-protein powerhouse, and the great news is we already have the intellectual and infrastructure assets to seize it,” said Food Frontier chief executive officer, Thomas King. “This research demonstrates overwhelmingly strong growth prospects for Australia’s plant-based meat sector over the next decade,” he added. “It comes off the back of a wave of new plant-based meat products, enabled by advances in food science and culinary creativity, that aim to mimic the sensory experience of eating conventional meat with fewer environmental and health impacts. “Put simply, we’re facing a multi-billion-dollar opportunity for Australia to become a global plant-protein powerhouse, and the great news is we already have the intellectual and infrastructure assets to seize it,” he said. “It’s crystal-clear that Australia has a massive opportunity on its doorstep, which this report aims to quantify,” King concluded.

12466,Future Food Exhibition at Amsterdam’s NEMO Science Museum,https://vegconomist.com/fairs-and-events/future-food-exhibition-at-amsterdams-nemo-science-museum/,2019-09-02,"An exhibition held at the brand new location for the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam looks at the future of food and explores questions such as: what will our meals look like in 2050? Where will our food come from, and how will it be produced? The exhibition addresses cultured meat, and the ways in which a fast-growing world population and climate change mean that we need to change the way we think about food.  Scientists, food technologists, designers, food startups, producers and philosophers are looking at new ways to create food, and their best ideas and products will be on display until the 6th October at De Studio, NEMO Science Museum’s new location on the adjacent Marineterrein. In the exhibition “Future Food”, NEMO Science Museum and Next Nature Network take visitors on a future food journey. Through plant-based, animal-based and functional food scenarios, visitors can look at the future of insects, artificial meat, genetically modified organisms, biotechnologies, plant-based alternatives, alternative cultivation methods, food as medicine, and entirely new sensory experiences with food. The exhibition is curated by Next Nature Network fellow and ‘food futurist’ Chloé Rutzerveld, who designed the Future Food Formula installation that invites visitors to design a ‘growth recipe’ for a future vegetable crop. The exhibition includes a wide variety of visions from the Netherlands and abroad. Film maker Matthijs Diederiks’ documentary looks at the world of the ‘functional foods’ which he lived on for a year, and the designer Ira van Eelen – daughter of the in-vitro meat inventor Willem van Eelen – together with the University of Bath explains how cultured meat is produced. “Everyone seems to agree that science should find solutions to important issues. It’s vital that citizens themselves also learn about scientific issues and technological developments. Not just to form an opinion about them, but to make active contributions towards solutions in their own living environments.” Michiel Buchel, director of NEMO. “Cooking is the first invention of humankind – and no other animals do it. Food is the most intimate technology, too, because it literally becomes part of your body. The choices we make today will influence future generations.” Koert van Mensvoort, director of Next Nature Network.    "

12499,BlueNalu Announces First-of-its-Kind Commercialization Strategy and Facility Designs for Large-Scale Production of Cell-Based Seafood,https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/bluenalu-announces-first-of-its-kind-commercialization-strategy-and-facility-designs-for-large-scale-production-of-cell-based-seafood/,2019-08-23,"BlueNalu, a leading innovative food company producing seafood directly from fish cells, announced today its commercialization strategy and food facility design schematics for large-scale production. This is the first time that any company has provided facility design schematics illustrating the vision for large-scale production of foods via cellular agriculture or aquaculture.   “We have developed an optimal strategy for scaling up production of cell-based seafood from a variety of finfish, crustaceans and mollusks to meet global demand,” stated Lou Cooperhouse, president & CEO of BlueNalu. “BlueNalu will provide products that are healthy for people, humane for sea life, and sustainable for our planet.  As a result, we can have a major impact on supplementing our global supply chain for seafood.” BlueNalu has created a five-phase commercialization strategy that starts with R&D and small-scale pilot testing, evolves to a phase that enables market research testing, and culminates in food facilities that are 150,000 sq. ft. under roof.  It is anticipated that each facility will produce up to 18-million pounds of finished seafood products per year, or about 72 million four-oz seafood fillets or equivalent units per year.  BlueNalu is currently entering its first phase of development, producing whole seafood medallions and fillets at pilot-scale, and plans to introduce products into a test market in two to three years. “Over the past year, we have engaged with bioprocessing and food engineering specialists, as well as architects that specialize in food facility design and construction, to determine the optimal process flow and the underlying assumptions that will result in maximum production capacity and flexibility, and minimal capital and operational costs. As can be seen from our schematics, each production facility will look like a hybrid between a microbrewery and a conventional food production facility. BlueNalu’s food facilities will produce an array of raw and cooked, fresh and frozen seafood products that are prepared in a trusted and familiar way,” said Cooperhouse. The BlueNalu facilities will each be designed to serve regional population centers, initially focused on serving countries in North America, Asia, and Europe, where there is the greatest current and projected per capita consumption of seafood. The company intends to replicate its initial facility to dozens of locations across the globe, making continual operational enhancements along the way, and selecting varieties of fish, product applications, and marketing channels to meet the needs of each selected region. BlueNalu’s strategy will contribute to a more stable global supply chain for seafood, in a way that supports the health, sustainability and biodiversity of our ocean. BlueNalu plans to produce seafood from species that are overfished, primarily imported, contain higher levels of mercury and other environmental pollutants, and/or are difficult to farm-raise. It also will focus initially on seafood that commands a premium price and has strong consumer familiarity. “We are pleased that consumers world-wide are embracing alternative proteins,” said Cooperhouse. “BlueNalu is excited to announce that large-scale production of cell-based seafood is achievable in the near term.”    "

12535,World’s Largest Pork Processor Smithfield Foods Launches Plant-Based Protein Portfolio,https://vegconomist.com/hot-off-the-vegan-press/worlds-largest-pork-processor-smithfield-foods-launches-plant-based-protein-portfolio/,2019-08-13,"Today, Smithfield Foods, Inc., announces the launch of a plant-based protein portfolio under the company’s new Pure Farmland™ brand. Its plant-based proteins will be available in the fresh, refrigerated sections of grocery retailers across the US in mid-September. Based in Smithfield, Virginia, Smithfield Foods is a $15 billion global food company and the world’s largest pork processor and hog producer. Its tagline is, “Good food. Responsibly,” and the company has seen criticism and exposure in recent years from various organisations due to its various practices with the 32,000 pigs killed daily. The new Pure Farmland products are said to cater to flexitarians – consumers who are actively consuming less meat in their diets. The new line comes in a variety of breakfast patties, meatballs, burger patties, and pre-seasoned protein starters. The products are offered in sustainable packaging with trays made from more than 50% recycled material. “We’re thrilled to announce the launch of this new product portfolio under our Pure Farmland brand. We’ve been exploring the alternative protein space, and have taken our time to get it right,” said John Pauley, Chief Commercial Officer for Smithfield Foods. “With this launch, we are bringing together our expertise in creating market-leading food products, our organizational commitment to sustainability, and our deep understanding of ‘flexitarian’ consumers, to deliver a broad variety of flavorful plant-based protein choices that consumers want and can afford at a great value.”    "

In fact, protein-seeking consumers are more likely than ever to consider all the options available to them.”  In the study named “Meet the New Meat Eater“, Nielsen Homescan consumer data reveals that 98% of meat alternative buyers in America also purchase meat products, and that in the USA, 15% of sales in F & B are on products that “support plant-based diets.” Americans appear to be specifically interested in products containing protein from spelt, seitan and lentils, which generate over $620 million. In terms of securing continued growth of alternative protein products, the data shows that alignment with social and environmental action is highly pertinent, especially with regards to the impact of animal agriculture on climate change, of which Americans are becoming increasingly aware. “Among Americans interested in the impact of livestock on climate change, 61% of those surveyed say they would reduce their meat consumption, 43% would replace meat-based protein with plant-based protein alternatives and 22% would become vegetarian or vegan in order to effect positive change.”    "

Shares have increased by 7% in Monday trading following the news. The processed food giant, whose subsidiaries include Hillshire Farms, Jimmy Dean and Ball Park, launched the nuggets this June with additional plans for burgers, sausages and meatballs, making it the largest US meat producer to launch its own products to the plant protein market. In our related article here vegconomist discussed the fact that the nuggets in fact contain egg whites and as such are not suitable for vegans. Tyson’s plantbased line Raised & Rooted was created as part of its attempt to appear more sustainable. Back in April the company stated to CNBC: “Tyson Foods continues to be committed to providing alternative protein as a choice for consumers and recently announced the creation of a new business focused on combining our creativity, scale and resources to make great tasting protein alternatives more accessible for everyone. We plan to launch an alternative protein product soon with market testing anticipated this summer.” CEO Noel White stated in relation to the quick rollout, “This kind of quick start demonstrates the capabilities and scale and national reach of Tyson Foods,” adding that the products will roll out internationally at a later stage. Meanwhile, Tyson has also received a subpoena from the Justice Department due to allegations of chicken price manipulation.    "

Recent months have seen major meat manufacturers and Big Food conglomerates including Tyson, Conagra, Danish Crown and JBS, to name a handful, turn to vegetable products as a way to regain profits and rebuild share prices. There are various ways in which some vegans might view such developments, but ultimately it must be acknowledged that, whatever the motivation, a global move away from meat production and towards plantbased meat, is a positive one for vegan business, the animals, and the movement as a whole. “Fast-growing consumer trends such as plant-based proteins are creating long-term growth opportunities for our comprehensive portfolio of food and beverage solutions,” commented ADM, as reported by Market Watch. The alternative protein market is now being taken extremely seriously by mainstream industry and investors around the planet, notably since the Beyond Meat stock market launch this May, after which BYND shares are trading at more than six times the initial IPO price. Alt protein expert Olivia Fox Cabane discusses this in terms of a “Kodak Moment” for meat and dairy in her vegconomist article here.    "
12619,Proveg: “Our Mission is to Reduce Global Meat Consumption by 50% Before 2040”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/proveg-our-mission-is-to-reduce-global-meat-consumption-by-50-before-2040/,2019-07-25,"Matthias Rohra started as Head of VEBU Business in mid-2015 and has been Chief Operating Officer at ProVeg since 2017. His profound knowledge of the international development of plant-based products and his strong business background allow him to work successfully along with political organisations in the promotion of the ProVeg cause; to reduce meat consumption worldwide.  Matthias has been vegan for over 25 years and also is an enthusiastic vegan cook. Here he speaks with us regarding the organisation and its important political work, including the current problems faced by the vegan movement of labelling restrictions. How many employees work for ProVeg and in which areas?
There are currently around 150 international employees and volunteers working for ProVeg. In addition, we are supported by a network of around 100 regional groups in Germany who are also committed to the ProVeg mission. In addition to Germany, we have established country teams in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and South Africa, with teams in China and the USA created a few months ago. Given that ProVeg wants to change the food system on a global level, most of our staff are also working on the organisation’s international activities. In terms of content, the main areas of our activities are Corporate Engagement and Media Outreach & Campaigning, as well as Political Outreach and Community Building. We work together with institutions and also support individuals in changing their diets. What is happening in terms of vegan lifestyles at the political level?
Unfortunately, the market for vegan products is currently facing political restrictions on food labelling. In Germany at the end of last year, the German Food Code Commission published guidelines for the labelling of vegetarian and vegan foods that are similar in function to foods of animal origin. It makes arbitrary distinctions and establishes incomprehensible rules. Together with a broad alliance of companies producing veggie alternatives, ProVeg has published a statement in which we make our criticism of the proposed guidelines very clear. In addition, the EU Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wants to ban the use of terms such as ‘burger’, ‘schnitzel’, and ‘sausage’ when labelling plant-based alternatives. However, given that a final decision has not yet been made, ProVeg launched a petition that has already been signed by more than 60,000 people in the space of a few weeks!  With the petition, we ask the incoming EU parliament to reject the proposal because it is unnecessary and irrational. There are no empirical studies or other evidence to suggest that consumers are confused or misled by the current names of vegan and vegetarian products. To claim that consumers do not understand the meaning of ‘veggie burger’ and similar terms is nonsense. Terms such as ‘burger’, ‘sausage’ and ‘milk’ for plant-based products convey the characteristics of the products to consumers with regard to use, taste, texture, and other factors. This established naming system has proven itself over the years, and there is no reason why it should be made more complicated. If the proposed legislation is implemented, no one will benefit: consumers will find it more difficult to make a choice if they want to switch to more sustainable and animal-friendly alternatives, and manufacturers will find it more difficult to market such products. This would be a completely misguided step – especially at a time when a reduction in the consumption of animal products is not only recommended by the United Nations and the German Nutrition Society (DGE), but can also make an important contribution to solving many pressing problems including climate change, species extinction, deforestation, global hunger, and mass livestock farming Keyword internationalisation: What’s the status quo?
Following the renaming of ProVeg, along with the simultaneous initiation of our internationalisation process three years ago, we are now represented in eight countries (Germany, Poland, United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, South Africa, the USA, and China) and are active in over 20 countries. We are currently placing a major focus on establishing ProVeg USA and consider a presence in the US to be of particular strategic importance –  not only because it is one of the countries with the highest per capita meat consumption, but also because of its economic influence in the world. Additionally, the USA is a hotbed of innovation for the development of alternative protein sources, including both plant-based products and cultured meats. A presence in China is also essential in the long term as the country has the world’s highest meat consumption due to its large population, with the consumption of meat and other animal products increasing considerably in recent years. ProVeg will continue with the internationalisation process in the coming years – on the one hand, through the consolidation of existing countries, and, on the other, through further expansion. We are attracting widespread interest from all regions of the world. We are naturally delighted about this and are satisfied that it confirms the validity of our approach. What plans do you have in store for the coming months?
We want to advance and intensify the internationalisation process, as well as our general activities in the various fields of work worldwide. Our core mission is to reduce global animal consumption by 50% by the year 2040. A number of projects, events, and campaigns are planned for the rest of the year, including the successful international campaign for World Plant Milk Day on 22 August 2019. Here, we work with producers of plant milk and coffee chains to encourage people to sample the many milk alternatives available. We also communicate the benefits of plant milks and focus on how extensive the demand for such products already is. At the end of August, the Vegan Summer Festival in Berlin, one of the largest vegan events in Europe, will be co-organised by ProVeg. At the same time, we are bringing together about 30 organisations from more than 20 countries for a Global Leadership Summit to share best practices and strengthen the global plant-based movement. On 12-13 October, ProVeg UK will be hosting and organising the first VegMed to take place outside of Germany. This medical congress, which will be held in London, will present the latest scientific findings on plant-based nutrition to a professional audience. Another exciting project is the rollout of our VeggieChallenge, which is intended to make it easier for people to get started with a plant-based lifestyle over the course of 30 days, through a daily newsletter with tips, videos, and recipes. What is the Global Leadership Summit and what topics are on the agenda in August?
The Global Leadership Summit is a three-day conference scheduled for the end of August that ProVeg is organising for the first time. Executives from more than 30 veggie organisations around the world will come to Berlin to share best practice strategies in all areas of work, including outreach strategies, campaign management, fundraising, and events. In addition to networking, there will be a focussed exchange on what approaches move people most effectively and contribute most to sustainable change. The optimisation of internal processes and procedures will also be a key topic. After all, we are all working towards the same goal – and mutual support is invaluable. ProVeg can learn a lot from the successes and mistakes of other organisations. The summit represents a huge opportunity to drive the global veggie movement forward.    "
12635,How to Launch a Vegan Industrial Revolution,https://vegconomist.com/society/how-to-launch-a-vegan-industrial-revolution/,2019-07-22,"Could ‘shroomdogs’ and ‘veggie ribs’ be modern emblems of British innovation? These were two of the meat-free delights on offer at Sainsbury’s ‘vegan butchers’ – the UK’s first – which opened its doors to Londoners in late June. As one of the country’s largest supermarkets, Sainsbury’s recent animal-friendly zeal exhibits veganism’s gradual growth from hipsterish novelty into mainstream cuisine. That growth, combined with challenges it has yet to overcome, make it a perfect target for some activist policymaking. Many vegans and vegetarians will have heard the complaint that abstaining from meat remains unaffordable for many families and households – with veganism in particular sometimes being labelled as ‘classist’. While it may sting one’s moral sensibilities, this largely misses the point. New habits and technologies have to pop up somewhere before they become widely adopted. If plant-based alternatives develop and familiarity with dietary alternatives spreads, these concerns should subside. Fresh economic thinking suggests how the state could help make that happen – through an industrial ‘mission’ for vegan innovation. A paradigm for economic policymaking theorised and championed by Mariana Mazzucato and UCL’s Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, industrial missions are enjoying a moment in the sun. The EU has drawn on this thinking for its R&D framework from 2020, Horizon Europe, while the Commission on Mission-Oriented Innovation and Industrial Strategy at UCL reviewed the UK government’s industrial strategy and the missions directed at achieving its ‘grand challenges’. The concept crystallises many emerging features of the post-recession turn in economics. It recognises that ‘growth has not only a rate but also a direction’; claims an active role for the state in shaping markets and ‘tilting the playing field’; and understands that tackling huge societal tasks like climate change calls for an interconnected, systemic response. Missions themselves, once set, channel policymaking down the best path we can envisage. Developing a mission for plant-based food would kick a burgeoning sector into overdrive. In what Waitrose calls ‘the era of the mindful consumer’, survey results frequently show more and more people claiming to live a meat-free lifestyle. While that includes vegetarians, the Vegan Society estimates just over one per cent of people in Great Britain abstain strictly from consuming meat or animal products. The number quadrupled over four years since 2014. Other surveys are more generous, depicting up to 7 per cent of Brits as active vegans. The gap, implying a wedge of respondents who stop short of practising veganism in full yet feel positively towards the term, only points to more room for growth. Industry research confirms the rate of growth and potential value as yet unrealised. In particular, the consultancy AT Kearney see cultured meat – made of animal cells cultivated in a lab – as the innovation with the greatest commercial potential. Mazzucato’s work stresses that missions are supposed to be ambitious and spur a creative approach to radical change that cuts across sectors and types of organisation. The Apollo moon landing is cited as a prototypical mission, requiring a flurry of technological and scientific development – all coordinated across different types of organisation. The wide variety of businesses and associations with a stake in the vegan industry should not be underestimated. A willing UK government could easily adopt a mission, say, to raise the proportion of British food accounted for by cultured and plant-based meat alternatives. The most costly innovations are clustered at the lab-grown end, making the most attractive target for investment in research and development. For plant-based meat replacements – already relatively well-established – public bodies could play a coordinating role to scale the existing range, by overcoming barriers from transportation to industry standards. Incentives for retailers to switch away from animal products would complete the value chain. The economic incentives are clear and extend to trade as well as simply growing markets domestically. Brexit-related fragility has exacerbated the threat posed by Britain’s current account deficit. The EU accounts for over 90 per cent of British meat imports, and 70 per cent of exports in the case of pork. Vegan alternatives could alleviate this dependency. While veganism is growing in many countries, the UK is certainly an epicentre of the dietary revolution: more vegan products were launched here than in any other country in 2018. However, the main benefits of the vegan rise are environmental. In its report on achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (as UK legislation now requires), the Committee on Climate Change noted that ‘diet change [and] major land use changes on the freed-up land… are both needed for a net-zero target.’ An important mechanism for decarbonisation is to increase forest cover (deforestation of land is a major reason why beef and dairy production is so heavily polluting), for which land reclaimed from animal farming is the ideal candidate. If we aim instead for a stringent 2030 target for net-zero (or, as Extinction Rebellion advocate, 2025), then ditching meat and dairy is an urgent priority. Whether under the Conservative government’s industrial strategy and its ‘clean growth grand challenge’, or Labour’s more wide-reaching plans for a ‘green industrial revolution’, addressing the future of agriculture will be crucial to the sustainable transition. A thoughtful commission on the subject could even examine links with sustainable fashion products – which enjoy broad public support – ensuring moves towards vegan fashion, such as replacing leather, are also environmentally sustainable. The point of mission-oriented policy is to aim big, and capitalise on connections between diverse actors that the market might not see. At first blush, a vegan industrial mission might not seem like a public-relations winner. Yet research into how best to market plant-based alternatives is already developing. Only the most cynical meat-lover could paint achieving mass dietary change in the 21st century as a more optimistic mission than putting a human being on the moon in the 20th.

The major investment, the second such facility in Manitoba, reflects continued growth in the sector, with more crop producers looking to give peas a chance.  Canada is one of the biggest producers of peas in the world, as well as the global leader in canola production. With industry innovators such as Beyond Meat using pea protein in their products, coupled with consumer demand for alternative proteins, and the rapid growth of veganism, pea-protein is experiencing something of a craze. The global plant-based protein producer Burcon NutraScience Corporation is opening the facility as a C$65million investment. Starting production next year, the 20,000 ton processing plant will create 80 – 85 new jobs near Winnipeg. The plant will switch between pea and canola protein production. “It will be the only commercial canola protein production facility in the world” said CEO Johann Tergesen in a recent interview with Bloomberg news. “We are actually realizing that the plant we’re building is too small,” Tergesen said, referring to the soar in demand. “We’re going to go ahead and build it this size, and we can expand”.

12679,Alt Dairy and Alt Protein Overwhelmingly Received Most US Funding in 2018,https://vegconomist.com/startups/alt-dairy-and-alt-protein-overwhelmingly-received-most-us-funding-in-2018/,2019-07-12,"Foodtechconnect has published its 2018 U.S. Food & Beverage Startup Investment Report, summarising the categories which received the highest levels of investment throughout the year. Dairy alternatives are the top category, hitting $200M, with alternative protein coming in a close second at $192M. The author states that “plant-based has hit prime time.”  The Foodconnect Investment Report, authored by Ryan Williams, examines U.S. based food and beverage investor trends by category, and overall industry trends. According to Williams in 2018 there was a total of $1.45+ billion invested across 247 Food & Beverage deals. He summarises: “With acquisitions on the rise and more capital flowing into the industry, 2018 was another great year for U.S. based food and beverage startups. The largest check size of the year was for $114 million to Impossible Foods.” Dairy alternatives was the top category of the year, bringing a total of $200M in investment, with three prominent companies raising over 40$: Ripple, Kite Hill, and Califia Farms. Second to dairy alternative was plantbased & cultured protein, which in total received $192M of funding, as follows: Impossible Foods – $114M Beyond Meat – $50M Good Catch – $8.6M BlueNalu – $4.5M Prime Roots – $4.3M *was Terramino* Finless Foods – $3.5M Wild Type – $3.4M NUGGS – $1.8M Outstanding Foods $1.5M New Age Meats – $0.25M SunRhize Foods – $0.23 (with an undisclosed amount from Alpha Foods) In terms of investor trends, the study finds that 2018 was more focused on maturation than innovation. Williams reports that plant-based is a primary focus for investment. “New Crop Capital, Powerplant Ventures, and Stray Dog Capital have all built impressive portfolios by focusing exclusively on the industry’s continued embrace of alternatives to meat, seafood, and dairy.” Williams finds that investors are more interested in food & beverage than in technology, “Only Horizons Ventures, which placed tech angled bets on Endless West, Impossible Foods, and Perfect Day; Kleiner Perkins, with its check to Beyond Meat; and Khosla Ventures, with its participation in Perfect Day and Ripple, represented the tech set. The intersection of new technology paired to food brands most excites this group.” Notable CPG trends included Big Meat investing in Cultured Meat, with Tyson backing Memphis Meats, SuperMeat receiving 3M from PHW and Bell Food Group investing in Mosa Meats. And Plant-based growth: Here Williams says that “Plant-based has hit prime time” – he discusses the success of Kite Hill, Ocean Hugger, Perfect Day, and mentions partnerships between Impossible Foods and a number of fast food outlets. Note that this report is for US startups only.    "
12718,Retail Market for Meat Substitutes and Alternatives Now a Billion Dollar Industry,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/retail-market-for-meat-substitutes-and-alternatives-now-a-billion-dollar-industry/,2019-07-03,"Major opportunities remain in meat and poultry, though not in the usual ways or for the usual players, according to U.S. Food Market Outlook 2019, a report by market research firm Packaged Facts.  Leading players have tried hard to innovate in meat and poultry with new and acquired products, using terminology such as grass-fed, free-range, and locally raised. Nevertheless, meat substitutes and alternatives have garnered much of the recent attention in the market, causing major producers to rethink their protein opportunities and take action. The report estimates retail sales of meat substitutes at about $1 billion, with sales traditionally driven by vegans and vegetarians. “Major food industry players have taken notice of shifting consumer trends regarding protein sources, and are acquiring or investing in plant-based brands to strengthen their competitive edge,” says David Sprinkle, research director for Packaged Facts. Lab-grown or cultured meat—produced by in vitro cultivation of animal cells rather than by the slaughter of animals—is cited in the report as being the next major market disruptor. In September 2018, producers agreed to use the term “cell-based meat” as opposed to “clean meat” to avoid controversy, however it is still referred to in a number of ways throughout the industry. Either way, looks like clean / cultured / lab meat could eventually disrupt animal products on a permanent basis.    "

Spirulina for instance has around a 70% rate. This is a collaboration with Dr. Peter Ralph and Dr. Alexandra Thompson of the UT Sydney, and is the one that is growing the fastest: within 4 days, the successive iterations had garnered more than 20,000 views and my LinkedIn inbox was flooded with logos and companies. Clearly, there was a pent-up demand, but it’s also a very active space. Unlike fungi, algae benefit from a certain ‘health halo’ (if it has spirulina in it, it must be healthy) Algae have an incredibly wide range of applications, and has long been part of mainstream industry. Fungi, on the other hand, has an image problem. Unlike algae, in western cultures fungi does not have the same health halo. In fact, in countries that do not have a culinary tradition that includes mushrooms, fungi often suffer from a negative association. To the average American, the word “fungus” is usually associated with “toenail.” This is a genuine tragedy, because fungi are a billion-species kingdom, the infinite applications of which we have barely scratched the surface. Of course they can play a key role in our future food systems: fungi are an infinitely sustainable, infinitely renewable resource. They also have the advantage of being cultivable anywhere — including impoverished industrialized areas, because all you need is a cellar. Not only do fungi (depending on the species) contain proteins, x, y, and z, they are also a fantastic medium for scaffolding and texturizing. But beyond food, fungi have the potential to replace, well, pretty much everything. From cosmetics to construction materials. From shoes, handbags, or furniture to pharmaceuticals. Fungi could actually remove animals from entire supply chains. This is one of the reasons I’m so keen to see a single-cell-protein incubator started. Algae, Fungi, and whatever we’ll end up calling the “air proteins” that are being grown in CO2 are all single-cell-proteins, and not only could they surely benefit from cross-pollination of ideas, an incubator could justify the purchase of expensive lab machines that each team might need use only infrequently. In the entire world, there are, at the moment, exactly zero SCP incubators. Anyone is welcome to use any of the landscapes in any presentation or publication, no need to ask me. Really. Just maintain attribution and you’re all set. If you need a different format, email o(at)askolivia.com. Why the landscapes: I truly believe foodtech will change the world. Although the word FoodTech is still unfamiliar to most, some day — perhaps soon — it will be as common as ‘biotech’ is now.

In essence, Olivia’s work is like a roadmap of the future, and offers a fascinating insight into the speed at which the future of food and biotech is developing, and progressing away from the old norms of animal proteins and other harmful products, so that we can have a more sustainable world.  Here, the author and educator, as well as Founder & CEO of The Global Alternative Food Awards (GAFAs), kindly takes the time from her busy schedule to talk to us about all of the landscapes which she personally developed, which offer a platform for all of the businesses changing the shape of protein and dairy, and the recent additions of algae and fungi. This was the first, and remains my favourite. It has an almost hypnotic quality to it. I could stare at it for hours, and in fact, often do. It’s the one that has grown the most, and what’s more, the growth comes from both established & new companies. From early 2018, when I first discovered this industry thanks to The Good Food Institute, to early 2019, there has been an explosion of new discoveries, companies, funds, collaborations, etc. Of course, many of the new entries in this landscape are established players branching out because they’ve recognized a growth opportunity; but the sheer number of brand-new entities is overwhelming. Startups on this map have already created: And for every startup looking for funding, there’s 2-3 funders wanting to invest. I now tell aspiring entrepreneurs: forget social media, alternative protein is where it’s at. Here’s the most up to date Protein landscape: There has been a veritable explosion of plant-based dairy offerings. Forget oat milk, how about lotus blossom milk? Or banana milk? The plant-based (PB) dairy market is steadily growing, while sales of fluid milk have fallen by 40% since the ‘70s and in fact recently hit a 75 year low. This is where you can most clearly see the coming “Kodak moment” for the dairy industry (click here for my article about the Kodak moment theory!). >> page 2: the Algae and Fungi landscape    "

The report was created in collaboration with experts including CEO of The Futures Agency and Author of “Technology vs. Humanity”, Gerd Leonhard, and Daniel Vennard, director of Better Buying Lab, World Resources Institute.  The report, titled “Checking into 2119” follows in the same vein as the Sainsbury’s document which recently predicted the next 150 years of supermarket trade, and says that in a hundred years our diets will be predominantly utilise plant-based or cultured meat proteins: “Plant Power: in 2119 our diets will be predominantly plant-based. Climate concerns will see us supplement farmed meats such as beef and lamb with lab-grown and 3D-printed alternatives.” The authors predict that hotels will feature allotment grown vegetables and vertical hydroponic crop-growing farms, using collected rainwater to maximise sustainability. “Giant indoor hotel allotments – a joint venture between Hilton Hosts and the surrounding communities – will grow hybrid vegetables with maximum nutritional value.” Interestingly, and un-veganly, the report predicts that in 2119 consumers will be used to eating protein sourced from insects: “Chefs will also harvest from on-site insect farms, a celebrated form of protein in 2119” …will be “unnecessary” according to the authors, who predict that “biometric information from embedded guest chips will provide chefs with food preferences, nutritional requirements, allergies and flavour tolerances on arrival. Chef-consultants will analyse every guest’s requirements individually, creating uniquely personalised dishes” and even further, that “chef-consultants will appear on demand to discuss preferences, before in-room 3D printers deliver the perfect dish for every taste.”    "

Olivia Fox Cabane is the founder & CEO of The Global Alternative Food Awards (GAFAs), lecturer on innovation and leadership at Stanford, Yale, Harvard and MIT, and best-selling author of books which have been translated into over 30 languages.  Here, Ms Fox Cabane discusses the future of dairy and meat, offering her privileged insight into these fast-moving industries. Next week vegconomist will publish a special two-part feature regarding her breakthrough work producing “landscapes” which depict the most current and upcoming companies in alternative proteins, plant-based dairy, algae and fungi.  Many observers are recognizing the dairy & meat industries’ “Kodak moment.” Did you know digital photography was actually created inside Kodak, by a Kodak employee? But Kodak’s business model was similar to that of razor companies: make money selling the film, not the camera. To them, digital photography was an existential challenge. Instead of recognizing this challenge, adapting to it or even embracing it, the company refused to change with the times, and so the times changed without it. Kodak filed for bankruptcy in 2012. The biggest meat companies have clearly seen this situation coming and most are being proactive, reinventing themselves as ‘protein’ companies and investing in alternative protein. In fact, Tyson Foods was until recently one of the largest funders of bioengineered  meat startup Memphis Meats, and are now bringing out their own line of plant-based meat. Cargill sold off the last of their feedlots two years ago, and like many other big meat companies now call themselves ‘protein’ companies. The dairy industry, on the other hand, is in a more reactive position and so far, despite the dramatic decline leading to bankruptcies in areas such as the USA’s Midwest, few dairy farms have been willing to consider transitioning from animal milk to plant milk.[1] This is unfortunate because those that have, such as Elmhurst Dairy, have experienced considerable success, and at least two separate task forces – the Farm Transformation Initiative and the Dairy Farmers Task Force – were established specifically to help struggling farmers gain access to more lucrative markets. I believe there will always be a niche market for high-end or specialized animal products, just as there is a market for top-quality film for both amateur and pro photographers. The day when alternative protein foods becomes cheaper than their traditional counterparts is inevitable. The day they match taste and texture too, it’s game over. As we say in Silicon Valley, every time technology challenges an established industry, technology wins. China is, right now, experiencing a virulent African Swine Flu epidemic which has already killed over a million pigs, and isn’t showing any signs of slowing down. The Chinese government has already expressed its desire to reduce meat consumption by 50% in 2050. Whether or not this goal is achievable, imagine what would happen if they decided to focus on making 3D printers affordable. Is there any country in the world that is better at cheap manufacturing? China could become world leader in 3D food manufacturing, hastening the day when the food printer is as commonplace as the microwave. When asked, “But will people ever accept lab-grown, test-tube, fake meat?” My answer is: ‘When did you last hear someone use the phrase “test-tube baby”?’ These days, IVF (in-vitro fertilization) is so commonplace that no-one would think of calling people born this way ‘lab-grown, test-tube, fake humans.’ But the greatest divide seems generational to me. Millennials and those younger seem quite comfortable with the idea of meat grown in a lab (after all, many of them were started this way.) This is part of the reason why Big Food is so keen on this space — see the dizzying rate of investments in alternative protein companies. Algae companies in particular are highly sought-after, perhaps because the bioavailability of algae protein is far higher than almost any other foods. Spirulina for instance has around a 70% rate. [1] When I mentioned the idea at SXSW to Wisconsin Dairy representatives, they burst out laughing and said “yeah, right. I don’t think so.” Olivia Fox Cabane is the cofounder of kindearth.tech and organizer of the upcoming Alternative Protein Summit in Amsterdam, August 26-28.    "

In previous years, events hosted by the Cultured Meat Symposium included scientists, researchers, key industry experts, investors, and members of the traditional meat and poultry industries. The conference, called the Cultured Meat Symposium, is focused on inspiring Silicon Valley high tech investors and entrepreneurs to get involved with cell-cultured meats and future food technologies. Cell-cultured meat technology has been increasingly popular since the debut of the first cell-cultured hamburger in 2013. The Cultured Meat Symposium aims to continue the research and growth of this new food technology sector through media and events. SVCMS, LLC has hosted, in conjunction with other groups, a range of organized events focused on these topics. In addition, SVCMS publishes a short-form podcast that invites industry experts to share their thoughts and ideas on the clean meat industry. The podcast is called the “Cultured Meat and Future Food” podcast can be found in iTunes, Spotify, and other podcast publishing platforms.  The Cultured Meat Symposium is to be held at Bespoke Events, an 18,000 square-foot event space, in the Westfield San Francisco Centre. The event will feature speakers from the industry including researchers, businesspeople, writers, and investors. General Admission ticket costs are $500. The event will also include demonstrations from some of the industry’s most recent developments. Attendees are invited to come and explore the exploding field of clean and cultured meat.

The one-day conference will bring together industry leaders from across the globe to present a range of topics on the growing trend, as well as how it will influence the future opportunities of the international meat sector.  In the annual survey conducted by Global Meat News, participants from the meat industry revealed that 6% of alternative proteins affected their businesses during 2017, and 61% were in favour of seeing more content on alternative proteins in the future. The event will highlight the latest developments and barriers in the rapidly expanding plant-based protein market. One of the speakers invited to present is Nicole Sopko, VP of independently owned Upton’s Naturals, which pioneered flavored seitan, kickstarted the jackfruit food trend in the States, and was the first to make pre-seasoned, heat-and-serve, natural jackfruit available in Europe. Her speech will cover the changing marketplace, how to build a plant-based brand and market it internationally, along with the growing popularity of jackfruit as a whole-food meat alternative. “I’m looking forward to taking part in The Future of Plant-Based Proteins conference to discuss my work with Upton’s Naturals,” said Nicole Sopko, VP of Upton’s Naturals. “So far I’ve been very impressed with Global Meat News’ commitment to expanding education into the area of meat alternatives. As interest in meat alternatives increases globally, there will be more events of this variety and The Future of Plant-Based Proteins is leading the way!”    "

Dr. Praeger’s is a family operated producer of vegetarian burgers since 1992, well-known for making burgers in the traditional vegetable style. The company has today introduced the Perfect Burger, made from a mix of vegetables, including sweet potato, butternut squash and carrot, in a bid to stay relevant and keep up with the market. At present the product is only being made available for foodservice. “The meat-alternative burger market lacks a tasty, vegan burger that contains a short and simple ingredient list,” says Larry Praeger of Dr. Praeger’s, “The Perfect Burger provides all the flavor you want from a traditional beef burger, but with clean plant-based protein and ingredients you can taste with each flavorful bite.” It will prove interesting as to whether the another new burger will compete in what must be an almost saturated market for realistic vegan burgers, or whether the market will continue to expand on the current trajectory. Dr. Praeger’s Perfect Burger will be available at restaurants and foodservice across the country. For availability, check out www.drpraegers.com.    "

This burger, which replaces the usual chicken fillet with a Quorn alternative, launches today June 17th. In the USA, however, KFC is seemingly not yet ready to go vegan. U.S. president of KFC Kevin Hochman said to CNN at the end of May, “We don’t see [vegan] chicken as the big trend right now. But we are definitely looking at [plant-based alternatives] in earnest and meeting with the big suppliers of alternative proteins to understand the market and where it’s headed.” However, vegconomist spoke to Peyton Klemm, Assistant Account Executive with global communications firm, Edelman, and was informed: “KFC US has no plans to test plant-based meat or meat alternatives at this time. We’re aware it’s a growing industry, and we are watching this trend closely to learn as much as we can. But our number one focus will always be making the world’s best-fried chicken by hand every day in every restaurant.” Klemm has agreed to update vegconomist on any potential future news so we can stay up-to-date on this trending topic.

Yesterday the Big Food player debuted its line of “plant-based” products, Raised & Rooted, which apparently makes Tyson the largest US meat producer to launch its own products to the alternative protein market.  In terms of operating in the market as competitors to Beyond Meat, of which Tyson owned a 6.5% stake until recently; Tyson reported $40 billion in sales in 2018, compared with Beyond Meat’s $210 million sales forecast for 2019. The Raised & Rooted line includes nuggets and burgers with the nuggets to become available in retail this summer and the burgers launching later in the year. “Today’s consumers are seeking more protein options, so we’re creating new products for the growing number of people open to flexible diets that include both meat and plant-based protein,” Noel White, Tyson Foods’ CEO, said in a statement published on businessinsider.com. “For us, this is about ‘and’ — not ‘or,'” he continued. “We remain firmly committed to our growing traditional meat business and expect to be a market leader in alternative protein, which is experiencing double-digit growth and could someday be a billion-dollar business for our company.” Meanwhile, VegNews reports that the Tyson nuggets contain egg whites and are as such not suitable for vegans.“Though Tyson said these ‘innovations’ make it the largest meat producer to enter the alternative protein space, we can’t help but wonder if a vegetarian item and animal meat burger really count,” animal rights organisation Compassion Over Killing commented to VegNews. “The company’s use of egg whites in this new product contributes to massive suffering on factory farms, where gentle hens are confined to tiny wire cages unable to stretch their wings or walk. Hens and cows deserve better, and even with this attempt to join the alternative protein space, Tyson is falling behind.”    "

These start-ups already exert an attraction and glamour on young top graduates in their countries, similar to that expected from Google, Tesla, or Apple.” In terms of other vegan innovations arriving on the market, the report mentions several companies which produce plant-based and cultured seafood, leather, silk, egg white, milk, gelatin, and horn. “As the structures of cultured milk, egg white, gelatin, and leather are not as complex as meat, these products might hit the market even earlier than cultured meat.” Other key points in the report include the following: •”Through 2018, the worldwide funding of novel vegan meat replacement companies reached $900 million […] Furthermore, meat replacement start-ups receive great financial and media support by large corporations, governments, and celebrities, including Richard Branson, Sergey Brin, and Bill Gates. •”The meat market will grow at a low rate in the coming decades as global population growth takes place mostly in locations with low meat consumption such as India and African countries. •”The consumer and legal acceptance of cultured meat will be a global phenomenon. This hypothesis is backed by several surveys in India, China, and the US as well as the global development toward “non-slaughtered” and resource-efficient products. •”Based on A.T. Kearney analysis, around one-third of the global meat supply will be provided by these new technologies within the next 10 years (see figure 9). It is noteworthy that the demand for conventional meat declines by 3 percent despite a global increase in meat consumption of 3 percent per year.”   DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The ""Global Cultured Meat Market - Analysis By Source (Poultry, Beef, Seafood, Pork), End Use, By Region, By Country (2021 Edition): Market Insights, Covid-19 Impact, Competition and Forecast (2021-2030)"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

But now, the company also intends to invest in the rapidly growing market for authentic meat alternatives.  Ikea’s decision follows a long series of new developments in the meat substitutes market this spring – from the successful stock market debut of Beyond Meat, to the new vegan burgers that will soon be available at Burger King in the US and in German McDonald’s branches, to Nestlé’s launch of a meat-like plant-based burger. Ikea is known around the world for its traditional Swedish meatballs and serves some 650 million guests a year in its restaurants worldwide. In fact, almost a third of Ikea’s customers have indicated that they don’t just go to the furniture store to shop. It is still unknown which plant-based protein the new meatballs will be made from, or with which of the companies in the alternative protein source market Ikea may enter into partnership. The first test runs are scheduled to start in the spring of next year, after which the products will be available at all the company’s restaurants worldwide. Last year, Ikea added a vegan hot dog made from kale, red lentils, quinoa, onions, and carrots to its menu. One million of these were sold in Europe in the first two months after their launch. In addition, since April 2019,  strawberry-flavoured soft vegan ice cream has also been available to customers in European stores, and will become available internationally over the course of the year.

12837,"Suprême: “We are Reinventing the Most Controversial French Delicacy, Foie Gras”",https://vegconomist.com/interviews/supreme-we-are-reinventing-the-most-controversial-french-delicacy-foie-gras/,2019-06-06,"  French startup Suprême is currently developing a foie gras which circumvents the cruel use of geese or ducks in the production method of this traditional spread. Suprême is striving to offer a product which is better for the environment, animals and also healthier for its consumers.  In order to create a product similar in taste and texture to the popular French delicacy, Suprême is making use of duck cells, without killing or mistreating any animal. We spoke with CEO and co-founder Nicolas Morin-Forest about this interesting product. Please introduce your brand to our readers.
Suprême is the first French cultured meat company and our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to humane, sustainable and healthy meat by harvesting it from cells instead of animals. It was founded end of 2018 by Antoine, Victor and Nicolas, three friends (two biologists and a business person) willing to have a positive impact on the world. We are first reinventing the most controversial French delicacy – foie gras. How is your foie gras produced and what makes it so special?
We start with a freshly laid egg from a duck from which we take a few cells. We place these cells directly into a “cultivator” where they are fed with basic nutrients, the same nutrients found in ducks’ natural diet (oats, corn or grass for instance). The cells have everything they need so that they keep multiplying indefinitely (once the best cells have been selected, we do not need eggs again). Then we adjust the nutrients and slightly increase the level of good, plant-based fat to obtain delicious, tasty duck foie gras that can then be cooked, seasoned and enjoyed. What was behind your idea for this production method?
Livestock production is currently estimated to contribute to 15% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a third of the global land use and water footprint. That is not sustainable. Besides, public health concerns are often associated with animal-based food products and everyday, 150 million land animals are killed for food around the world. On top of that, meat consumption is projected to double by 2050. We urgently need to come up with new solutions to produce the meat we love as we think it’s unlikely that humanity massively switches to plant-based diets overnight. Producing 1 kilogram of cultured meat this way involves approximately 7 to 45 percent lower energy use, 78 to 96 percent lower greenhouse gas emissions, 99 percent lower land use and 82 to 96 percent lower water use. Without even mentioning the controlled conditions that will improve food safety or the fact that no animal needs to be slaughtered. So cultured meat is definitely part of the solution as it provides the same experience and nutritional benefits without all the bad outcomes! Since this procedure includes cells derived from animals, do you consider vegans a serious target group for Suprême?
We think anyone who loves foie gras and meat in general but is not comfortable with its impact, wether it’s on the environment or animals, will engage with our brand! So we consider meat lovers as our core target group. Of course vegans are more than welcome as well but we are aware that our products will not appeal to all vegans. How do you assess French consumers’ interest in sustainable and cruelty-free food?
In France, our love story with foie gras is turning cold. In fact, 75% of French consumers are now uncomfortable with the way foie gras is produced and would love a cruelty-free alternative. The trend is massive, although most of us keep eating foie gras as it’s so deeply rooted in our culinary culture and traditions. So there’s a huge and growing unmet demand. One of our priorities is to understand how people feel about this new category of products, what are their hopes and questions. We don’t really pay attention to consumer acceptance studies, we prefer spending a lot of time engaging directly with different groups of people, mostly on social media where we’ve already had more than 2,000 conversations. We’re very confident because although a lot of people come up with questions or objections, in fact they very easily understand the benefits of cultured meat if properly explained. The key is to be empathetic and fully transparent. After a short explanation, most people end up saying « Alright then, I’ll follow you if your foie gras is delicious! ». That is truly energizing! At which stage of development of your product are you for the time being and when do you expect to finalise its recipe? / When will your foie gras be launched and where will it be available?
We have succeeded in our first technical breakthrough: replicating the effect of force-feeding directly at the cell level. So we have the first part of our recipe. Now we need to work on the taste and texture to make sure that when our foie gras hits the market, it’s as delicious as the conventional version. That’s our priority, as well as making sure it’s safe to eat, obviously. We will be working with European regulators on this and it’s hard to put a precise timeline on that regulation process. We are doing our best so our foie gras hits the market by 2022 or 2023. It will first be available online in limited quantities as well as in a few select restaurants. Do you already have plans to bring more products to the market?
Reinventing foie gras is only the beginning of our journey. We are building a complete production platform around duck cells and we want our next product to be a daily product. We like the idea of a duck burger. Duck meat is a great combination of rich taste and nutrition and it’s very popular in Asia. So we are definitely looking at the Asian market, like any food company willing to have the biggest positive impact should!    "
12875,Beyond Meat Builds First Factory in Europe,https://vegconomist.com/hot-off-the-vegan-press/beyond-meat-builds-first-factory-in-europe/,2019-05-28,"Following its astonishing stock market launch this month, industry disruptor Beyond Meat has announced it is building its first ever production facility outside of the US, and it will be based in Zoeterwoude, Netherlands. Beyond Meat began distributing their products across Europe into retail and food service in 2018 to extraordinary response. Last November, the burgers, which were originally intended to arrive into Tesco stores in August, finally landed three months late in the UK due to unprecedented demand overcoming production capabilities. In April of this year the burgers were introduced into Swiss Co-Op stores, and this month into German Lidl stores. The new facility will see its first alternative protein patties for the European market ready for shelves in 2020. In order to meet the increasing demand on the other side of the Atlantic, a factory will be built by meat giant Zandbergen World’s Finest Meat in the first quarter of next year. “As the demand for vegetable products in Europe continues to grow, we are very enthusiastic that we can work with Beyond Meat to produce their innovative products outside the United States,” said Zandbergen’s commercial director Adriaan Figee.

12883,Meat Alternative Category to Reach $140Bn According to Barclays Report,https://vegconomist.com/hot-off-the-vegan-press/meat-alternative-category-to-reach-140bn-according-to-barclays-report/,2019-05-27,"According to analysts at investment bank Barclays, the meat alternative market is on course to attain an annual value of $140 billion over the next decade, giving the meat-free category around 10% of the $1.4 trillion global meat industry.  The Barclays study, entitled Can’t Believe it’s Not Meat, predicts a rapid exponential growth for the alternative protein industry, based on a variety of factors. Bankers who have studied the continual rise in this category note that consumers are attracted to alternative proteins because production avoids the harm of animals and is less damaging to the environment, as long as its health benefits. The bank pointed out that investors feel there are still risks remaining. The health benefits may not be 100% clear at this point due to the use of additives which make a meat flavour, and also there is the risk of governmental labelling restrictions which may affect marketing and growth. In the long-term though, the analysts said that  “there is a bigger market opportunity for plant-based (and maybe even lab-based) protein than perhaps was argued for electric vehicles ten years ago.” The report comes in the wake of frenzied interest in this market since the phenomenal success of Beyond Meat’s IPO, which priced its initial share at $25 and closed its first day of trading at $65.75, which is 163% above its IPO price. According to reports, this makes Ethan Brown‘s company the biggest performing IPO in almost twenty years. Key points from the report include the following: • “Animal-based protein is becoming increasingly controversial given it is seen by some as one of the most important sources of greenhouse gas emissions, is energy intensive, and generates a lot of waste, not to mention its association with health concerns.” • “Although today we believe that there are inherent barriers to successfully replicating certain animal-based consumer favorites (e.g., t-bone steaks), what has been achieved so far in terms of ‘meatless’ ground beef, sausage and hamburger products has yielded positive initial consumer reaction.” • “While lab-based meat is still likely several years away from hitting supermarket shelves, plant-based protein continues to gain ground vs. its animal-based counterpart, and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future.”    "
12885,India Increases Clean Meat Investments and Research Efforts,https://vegconomist.com/politics-law/india-increases-clean-meat-investments-and-research-efforts/,2019-05-27,"The Indian government has started promoting the research and development of cultivated meat, also known as “clean meat”. Amongst other things, the government is subsidising the creation of two new research institutes for cell-based meat. The country is increasingly recognizing the great potential of this promising food segment, not least with regards to the nutritional needs of its own population. A new research facility is to be built in Maharashtra as the result of a partnership between the government-funded Institute of Chemical Technology Mumbai and The Good Food Institute India. The second institute will be located in Hyderabad and will be subsidized with over $640,000 from the government-funded Department of Biotechnology to the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology and the National Research Centre on Meat. This represents the largest ever investment in cell-based meat by a state government to support global food security research in the face of a growing world population. India itself currently has a rapidly-growing population of about 1.34 billion people, giving it a strong incentive to promote research into laboratory-grown foods in order to provide sufficient quantities of protein-based foods to its own population. Although a large proportion of the Indian population is still vegetarian, more and more people are consuming meat due to rising household incomes. Since the production of lamb and poultry meat, for which demand in India is particularly high, requires more land and water than the cultivation of plant-based foods, the country faces a major challenge if it is to guarantee a sustainable and secure diet for its citizens. In addition, India has many experts in biopharmaceuticals, mechanical engineering, and biotechnology, all of which are important for the development and optimisation of cultured meat products. However, there has been a lack of capital, research projects on consumer behaviour, entrepreneurship, and a legal framework in this area. According to The Good Food Institute, public-private partnerships should be able to counteract this and promote research in this field. The Good Food Institute believes that cell-based meat products could soon be available at affordable prices for consumers in India and beyond. In other countries, the starting conditions are similarly difficult, but there is increasing investment from the private sector to promote clean meat startups. According to projections by the Good Food Institute, over the past ten years investors have spent a total of more than 16 billion US dollars on companies producing plant-based and laboratory-cultivated meat alternatives, of which 13 billion US dollars alone was spent between 2017 and 2018. Nevertheless, without stronger government research funding, the US could soon fall behind the competition in this field. “For every dollar we currently invest in agricultural research, a total of 20 US dollars in profits will be made,” reports Jessica Almy of The Good Food Institute. “In my opinion, it would be realistic to predict that cultivated meat could be even more profitable.” Further hurdles on the US market are the lack of a legal framework and the regulatory requirements, as well as production costs which are currently still high.

12893,A Quarter of Brits Will be Vegan by 2025 and Half will be Flexitarian,https://vegconomist.com/studies-and-numbers/a-quarter-of-brits-will-be-vegan-by-2025-and-half-will-be-flexitarian/,2019-05-24,"UK Supermarket giant Sainsbury’s has released a study about the future of food to commemorate its 150th birthday. The 34 page report makes predictions about the next 150 years of food, including algae milk lattes and cellular meat as a “genuine market competitor to farmed meat.”  The Future of Food Report discusses what consumer habits, “driven by unprecedented awareness of animal welfare, health concerns and eco-anxiety,” will look like in 150 years, offering scenarios in the years 2025, 2050, and 2069, based on analyses of shopping trends and statistics and offering insight from several food experts. “It’s expected that a quarter of all British people will be vegetarian in 2025 (up from one in eight Britons today) and half of us will identify as flexitarians (up from fifth today). Sainsbury’s alone has already seen a 24% increase in customers searching for vegan products online, and a 65% increase in sales of plant-based products year-on-year, as customers increasingly consider a vegan, vegetarian or flexitarian lifestyle.” With regards to alternative proteins, the report says that between “2016 to 2019, dozens of companies were launched, with many attracting high profile investment.” According to these findings, the “non-traditional or alternative proteins market ($4.2 billion in 2016) is expected to grow more than 25 per cent by 2025.” Sainsbury’s cites jackfruit as an example of a plant-based protein that has seen enormous success over the past three years, and discusses their coming innovations in this field, including banana blossom, algae milk, and various mushroom derived products. In terms of cultured meat, Sainsburys looks ahead to the year 2050 and predicts that these products be a normal part of consumer life, and introduces to the layman reader the concept of “cellular proteins, ‘meaty tissue’ cultivated independently from animals using stem cells,” stating that by “2050, there is no doubt that this will be a genuine market competitor to farmed meat.” “Rather than getting a cut of meat at the supermarket, consumers may well be able to get their own grow it yourself ingredients for home-cultured meat, fish, eggs, milk or gelatine, at a fraction of the cost that exists today. Cellular protein could be a tool to help us meet the protein needs of a growing global population of the future.”    "

This spring is undoubtedly seeing a vegan revolution in the fast food world. Now we hear news that another American fast food giant, Chick fil A, is considering meat replacement options on their menus to cater for vegans. “We’re definitely aware, and I would say we’re always interested in, what’s happening in food,” Executive Director Amanda Norris said to Business Insider. “Specifically … a vegetarian option or a vegan option is something we’re looking at, we’re thinking about, and have some [research and development].” “I think it goes back to how far will our customers want us to go,” said Norris. “We think it is certainly beyond just no meat on salads or no meat in a wrap. It might be some kind of alternative protein on a sandwich,” Norris continued. vegconomist has contacted Chick fil A for comment. "

12984,Expert Explains Why You Shouldn’t be Discouraged From Clean Meat,https://vegconomist.com/business-insiders/expert-explains-why-you-shouldnt-be-discouraged-from-clean-meat/,2019-05-07,"Environmental impact and food sustainability are common concerns of many vegans. When the idea of cultured meat first emerged, many scientists hailed it to be the perfect solution to both of these problems. Recently however, a study from another group of scientists has argued that it might not be as perfect as first expected. Cultured meat, also known as cell-based meat or clean meat is seen as the future alternative to reduce conventional meat consumption. The meat, either from beef cells, or feather ends from chickens, is grown in laboratories. Although it is technically possible, at this early stage scientists are still figuring out the optimal conditions to grow these cells and how to scale up the production to meet consumer demand. The most plausible idea at the moment is to grows the cell productions to special containers called bioreactors which are essentially huge tanks similar to those used in beer production. Comparing to current livestock in the pasture system, cultured meat can reduce the use of land and water, and even some greenhouse gases such as methane from ruminants. Dr John Lynch and Prof. Pierrehumbert from the University of Oxford estimated that under the three presumed trends of meat consumption, the temperature increased by cultured meat production would eventually outdo the conventional cattle system. Their research is based on four existing publications in the field, but they commented that the current models from these studies count the effects of all greenhouse gases to be the same as carbon dioxide. In their project they studied each individual greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) separately and concluded that, over 1000 years, the temperature rise would be significantly higher through the production of cultured meat than the current conventional system. Their research report was published in the journal Frontier sustainable food systems in February 2019. The report immediately captured the attention of the media. For example, it led the BBC to write an article entitled “Cultured lab meat may make climate change worse”. Since the article was published more people have become sceptical about clean meat technology. To be expected, many scientists did not agree with the research findings. Dr. Hanna Tuomisto, whose research was quoted in the article, was quick to respond at the Proveg New Food conference a month later. Firstly, she expressed reservation because the research projections were based on the limits of existing clean meat technology. All technology improves swiftly over time so to not take this into account over a 1000 year period is ridiculous. Secondly, as of yet, no cultured meat company has scaled up and manufactured their prototypes in a factory. Currently, scientists can only estimate how companies would scale up production up from a lab to a factory size operation. The research from Dr John Lynch and Prof. Pierrehumbert simply took the figures we know about the current environmental cost of growing small quantities of clean meat in the lab and simply multiplied these to meet the requirements for large scale consumer consumption. If I wanted to estimate the energy costs of baking 25 million cookies, it wouldn’t be accurate to calculate how much energy my own consumer kitchen appliances used to create 25 cookies at home and then simply multiple by 1 million. Aside from the need to meet demand, the whole reason behind producing food on a mass industrialised scale is to bring down the production costs and increase profit per unit sold. The increased profit margin obviously coming from a reduction in energy used per unit. Although, lab based meat production is different in nature to baking cookies, to assume it would not follow the same energy reduction patterns when scaled is a another huge oversight. To his credit, Dr Lynch, the lead author admitted in an interview with popular online magazine Quartz that during his research they did not have full access to all the necessary technical information because of trade secrets, ‘We did the best we could. We surveyed all the literature, but it’s still a fundamental problem that we have no idea whether [the data] correspond with what the companies are doing or not.’ The Oxford scientists mentioned that previous studies have overlooked the negative impacts on climate change, because these environmental scientists assumed that greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide are equivalent to carbon dioxide when its comes to temperature rise. Despite it being a common research methodology, they argued that carbon dioxide, which is the only greenhouse gas produced from cultured meat production, lasts longer than the other two gases in the atmosphere. They argue that in the long run, climate change caused by carbon dioxide from lab-grown meat production would surpass methane and nitrous oxide from the livestock systems. They implied that cultured meat production would cause a significantly higher earth temperature than the conventional cattle system over a 1000 year period. Considering the earth’s average global temperature actually increased by 0.85°C from 1880 to 2012 (132 years), their studied time frame does not look realistic. Climate change itself is an issue we must take care of immediately and the United Nations has already proposed a goal of zero net carbon dioxide emission by 2050. The group specifically emphasised the temperature changes caused by greenhouse gas emission, in the conventional and cultured meat system. While Dr. Tuomisto and other scientists have also found that greenhouse gas emission and temperature change could rise through cultured meat production, they have also analysed other environmental parameters, such as water use, land use and waste management. Together these parameters form what is known Life-cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA provides a better picture of environment impacts, by taking into account the whole ecosystem. Even though carbon dioxide emission from cultured meat production is currently high, it would reduce the number of trees chopped down for pasture which in turn would conserve the carbon dioxide balance. The environmental specialists involved have explained that their research findings are based on honest presumptions about a technology still in the early stages of development. Without more detailed figures surrounding the production of cultured meat on a large scale, it is too early to make an accurate comparison of its environmental impact over the next 1000 years compared to conventional farming. While such reports have the ability to sway public opinion regarding cultured meat, the media attention they generate is not actually the major obstacle facing the emerging lab meat industry. Continuous rises in meat consumption throughout recent decades, fueled by large scale conventional farming, have created a disconnection in the minds of consumers between animal slaughter, consumer purchasing and meat consumption. A disconnection that is hindering us from realising the true potential of clean meat and the need for a greater cultural change when it comes to the production and consumption of meat. Stay updated and be optimistic because scientists are trying very hard to save our planet Earth, our animals and of course ourselves.

Plans New Fundraising Round to Develop Lab Chicken, Pork and Beef",https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/just-inc-plans-new-fundraising-round-to-develop-lab-chicken-pork-and-beef/,2019-04-30,"San Francisco food startup Just Inc. is changing course, from specializing in plant-based animal replacement products to creating cultured meat as well. To date, the flagship products have been Just Egg and Just Mayo, made from the liquid by-product of mung beans and peas, and now the company is planning a new round of fundraising ahead of an initial public offering to help raise money for developing chicken, pork and beef in a lab.  CEO Josh Tetrick is not pitching this new direction at vegans, but rather the new wave of omniverous consumers who don’t necessarily want to give up meat; however, they know that current methods of farming are not sustainable, or ethical. This group of consumers is repeatedly demonstrated to be the driving force behind the growth in sales of meat replacement products. According to data from Nielsen, supermarket sales in alternative meat surged 19.2% to $878 million in 2018. Just Inc. was formally Hampton Creek, a name that Tetrick moved away from after facing probes by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, for possible securities violations and criminal fraud, these investigations were later dropped. He has also faced a lawsuit over a trademark. 2017 was a turbulent year as Target Corp terminated their relationship with Hampton Creek, and Tetrick, was the sole person on the board as everyone left, having since been replaced. Tetrick said in a recent interview with Bloomberg: “The best way to do meat is not to do plant-based, but a meat-based approach. Meat is part of our culture and identity, the way men and women think of themselves.”      "

If Beyond Meat stock eventually sells at the top end of this bracket, the company will be valued at $1.2 billion.  As Beyond prepares to file their listing, news has emerged that meat manufacturer Tyson Foods Inc. has sold its 6.5 percent stake in the startup. According to reports, Tyson representatives have recently been unwelcome at Beyond’s board meetings, and tensions have been running high between both parties since Tyson’s CEO, Noel White, announced plans to create an own-brand plant-based protein line. At this point it has not been disclosed as to who has purchased the stake, and it has not been announced whether Tyson offered to sell its shares or whether Beyond requested the move. Tyson Foods released the following statement to CNBC: “Tyson Ventures is pleased with the investment in Beyond Meat and has decided the time is right to exit its investment. Beyond Meat provided an early opportunity for Tyson Ventures to invest in plant-based protein products that many consumers are seeking. We wish the leadership of Beyond Meat all the best. “Tyson Foods continues to be committed to providing alternative protein as a choice for consumers and recently announced the creation of a new business focused on combining our creativity, scale and resources to make great tasting protein alternatives more accessible for everyone.

13051,The Meat Substitution Market Continues to Thrive,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/the-meat-substitution-market-continues-to-thrive/,2019-04-18,"Modern-day vegans are increasingly turning to meat alternatives. The rise of flexitarianism is also creating a huge market for food products that look and taste like meat. The meat replacement market is expected to exceed $6 billion dollars globally by 2023 according to AustralianNews.com.  Food tech is big business, with small companies gaining from large investors like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos; experienced, wealthy business people who sense the change in attitudes towards environmental issues. The market is being driven by people concerned about environmental and animal welfare, but who are busy and want products that contain the protein, taste and look of the original animal products. Companies like Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat and Gardein expand and grow whilst new innovations with cultured meat are coming to stores and restaurants in the near future, all clamouring to meet the global demand of meat substitution. Ms Sukul Lee, a software engineer from New Zealand, told Australian News.com that she had had an “existential crisis” and decided in 2015 that she needed to change paths. She established Sunfed Foods, secured $10 million Series A funding in a round led by Australia’s Blackbird Ventures, and gathered a group of engineers to help her manufacture a product that was she describes as a “true alternative to meat”. Ms Sukul Lee was determined to create an animal-free product with the low carb, high protein nutritional benefits of meat, using the most simple and natural products possible. By 2017, her chicken-free chicken was flying off the shelves of New Zealand’s two biggest supermarkets and is set to launch in Australia by June, along with a beef-free burger.    "
13061,Strengthening Germany’s role as a Pioneer: Association for Alternative Protein Sources is Founded,https://vegconomist.com/politics-law/strengthening-germanys-role-as-a-pioneer-association-for-alternative-protein-sources-is-founded/,2019-04-16,"An association for alternative protein sources, 
“Verband für Alternative Proteinquellen” (Association for Alternative Protein Source / BALPro) has been operating in
Düsseldorf since March of this year. The association acts as an independent interface between the media, industry, research, consumers and politics.  -A more sustainable funding policy and low-threshold access to funding for projects involving alternative protein sources
-Promoting investment in sustainable raw materials
-The provision of transparent and understandable information
-Further strengthening Germany’s pioneering role by promoting sustainable and innovative nutrition solutions “Alternative protein sources have the potential to change the food industry in the long term and are already very successful on international markets,” explains co-founder Fabian Ziemßen. “That is why we should continue to advance this future topic, especially in Germany, a strong location for innovation, in order to assume a pioneering role in the market. While Germany is lagging behind in other future technologies such as e-mobility, we have the chance to play a pioneering role worldwide.” The movement was initiated by startups, companies and food experts. Following the motto “We create clarity”, 30 players have joined forces under the umbrella of the association to date, including market leaders, start-ups, young scientists and international trading companies. Fabio Ziemßen (33) from Düsseldorf, and Sebastian Biedermann (32) from Hanover, form the board of the association. They already had the idea to found the association a year ago. “We recognized that enterprises, which concern themselves with alternative food such as products on vegetable basis, simply a political voice are missing , explain Biedermann the origin of the idea. “Young founders in particular have their hands full with their core business. There is hardly any time left to discuss topics such as political representation of interests and the writing of long grant applications. Resources for research and development are also often lacking. However, these companies in particular are important for progress in the entire food industry and an important factor for Germany as a location for the future. They think outside the box and make niche products socially acceptable. They are the drivers of innovation”. Ziemssen adds: “Risk capital and investment are also comparatively underdeveloped in Germany. It is not easy to realise good product ideas in Germany if there is little or no capital available.” Ziemssen adds. According to its position paper, the association, which has been officially registered in the Register of Associations of the Düsseldorf Local Court since March, wants to stand up for these players and possible projects. A further driver of the association’s foundation is the goal of transparency. Hardly anyone is able to see through the extensive process chains from the cultivation of raw materials to supermarket shelves. At the same time, the complexity is necessary to guarantee a complete supply and to meet the high demand. Within this area of tension, public discussions on sensitive issues such as ecology, animal welfare and health are often one-dimensional, driven by individual interests and emotionally charged. As a result, this often leads to uncertainty among consumers. From the point of view of the association founders, the appropriate reaction to this situation is not the one-sided presentation of facts, but the provision of transparent and comprehensible information. “With our experts, we compile objective information on aspects such as production ecology, ethics and profitability. Our aim is to translate this information into an understandable language for the public,” says Sebastian Biedermann, describing the association’s project. This is not a revolution against animal products. According to the position paper, the focus is on open dialogue between all stakeholders.    "
13083,Lightlife: “Vegan Consumers are the Tip of the Spear and Many are Following Their Lead”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/lightlife-vegan-consumers-are-the-tip-of-the-spear-and-many-are-following-their-lead/,2019-04-10,"Lightlife Foods, founded in 1979, is the #1 refrigerated alternative protein brand in U.S. retail. Lightlife is part of the plant-based portfolio of Greenleaf Foods, who announced yesterday plans to construct North America’s largest plant-based protein manufacturing facility, which will enable Lightlife to more than double its production output.  The company is committed to making plant-based eating more accessible and delicious with products that appeal to consumers at all points of their plant-based journey—whether they’re newly vegetarian or vegan, or simply trying to moderate their meat consumption. We were very pleased to speak with Michael Lenahan, VP of Marketing for Lightlife Foods, about the hugely popular American brand. What is your current line / portfolio?
Lightlife recently announced the launch of a new line of pea protein-based products—the Lightlife® Burger, Lightlife® Ground, Lightlife® Italian Sausage and Lightlife® Bratwurst. The hero of the new line is the Lightlife® Burger—a new plant-based burger free of GMOs, gluten, soy and artificial flavors—that delivers the sensory experience consumers crave from a beef burger. Thanks to a culinary approach to product development, the Lightlife® Burger is made from familiar ingredients—including high-quality pea protein, virgin coconut oil, and beet powder, which work together to make a juicy and meaty burger. Because it’s grown to grill, cooking the burger over an open flame will enrich its tender, beefy texture. Which are the bestsellers and why?
Lightlife is proud to make the US’s #1 brand of tempeh and the #1 plant-based hot dog, Smart Dogs. Both are heritage products for the brand, and deliver the taste, quality and nutrition that consumers seek when shopping for plant-based proteins. Where is your product line available and do you have plans to expand into other markets?
Lightlife is currently available in over 21,000 retailers across the U.S. In the near future, consumers will start to see our new pea protein-based products roll out into retail and food service. What differentiates Lightlife from other plant-based products / how do you stand out against any competitors?
Lightlife products are rooted in great unifying taste, fueling discovery with a wide variety of products, and creating positive energy that you can feel good about because it nourishes you up without weighing you – or the planet – down. The Lightlife® Burger delivers on what its competitors cannot: a delicious burger with great taste, 73% less saturated fat than a traditional burger, and is free of GMOs, gluten, soy and artificial flavors. Do you have any new vegan products that you will launch or that are in development?
We recently announced our new line products that include the Lightlife® Burger, Lightlife® Ground, Lightlife® Bratwurst Sausage and Lightlife® Italian Sausage. At this time, we’re not able to share any additional innovations, though consumers can expect more exciting products from Lightlife in the very near future! In your opinion, why should the protein foods industry continue to acknowledge veganism?
The plant-based meat category is growing rapidly—in fact, according to SPINS data, as of February 2019 it has grown more than 30%. Lightlife, owned by Greenleaf Foods, SPC, has been a pioneer in plantbased alternatives for 40 years and continues to pave the way with best-selling plant-based meat products. Lightlife was purchased by Maple Leaf Foods about two years ago to support its goal of becoming the world’s most sustainable protein company by diversifying its product portfolio and adapting to changing consumer preferences and behaviors. Vegan consumers are the tip of the spear for plant-based diets and many are following their lead. What are your plans for the end of 2018 and 2019?
Right now, our priority is launching the new line of pea protein-based products, like our Lightlife® Burger, while supporting all the other great items that we already have in market. The new products are debuting the new Lightlife branding in celebration of the brand’s 40th anniversary this year. The new product line, brand redesign, and supporting advertising campaign are the largest investments the company has made in its history, which we’re wildly excited about. Where do you see Lightlife in the next five years?
As the category leader, Lightlife will continue to attract new consumers and delight those who have been on the plant-based journey with the brand over the last 40 years. With a rich pipeline of new products across our broad portfolio, best-in-class operational capabilities, and engaging consumer campaigns, Lightlife will continue to lead this dynamic category in the U.S. and Canada into the future. Lightlife® Chicken Tenders and Fillets available now at Sprouts Farmers Market locations nationwide CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Lightlife® (“Lightlife”), owned by Greenleaf Foods, SPC, announced today two first-of-its-kind plant-based products: Plant-Based Chicken Tenders and Plant-Based Chicken Fillets.

13182,Study Shows Asian Consumers More Ready for Lab Meat,https://vegconomist.com/studies-and-numbers/study-shows-asian-consumers-more-ready-for-lab-meat/,2019-03-12,"A new study carried out by Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems, surveyed 987 American, 1,024 Indian, and 1,019 Chinese consumers regarding the notion of diet flexibility and their “food neophobia”, or the reluctance to try new foods. The findings demonstrated that Asian consumers were far more accepting of the idea of trying new cultured foods such as lab grown meats.  Frontiers mention the results of a 2018 survey by Surveygoo which found that 40% of US consumers would buy clean meat, compared to only 18% for UK consumers, and in addition, Hoek et al. found significantly higher use of plant-based meats in the UK compared to the Netherlands. The Frontiers survey is reportedly the first to address the issue of acceptance towards cultured meat in India. China and India are identified as the prime regions in which to assess consumer opinions of clean meat, these countries have the highest population, and their rising economies and increasing numbers of consumers who can afford to purchase meat, signifies that meat consumption will continue to rise dramatically over the next decades. Key findings from the study include the following:    "
13192,Bill Gates: Environmental Benefits of Cultured Meat “Sketchy at Best” – The Experts Respond,https://vegconomist.com/marketing-and-media/bill-gates-environmental-benefits-of-cultured-meat-sketchy-at-best-the-experts-respond/,2019-03-08,"  MIT Technology Review published last week their annual Ten Breakthrough Technologies edition, this time curated by Bill Gates in a piece titled, “Bill Gates: How we’ll invent the future.” In his list of technologies he believes will shape the future, Gates includes the “cow-free burger” and discusses how “lab-grown meat improves our quality of life.”  In his introduction to the edition, Gates says of cultured meat: “Growing animal protein in a lab isn’t about feeding more people. There’s enough livestock to feed the world already, even as demand for meat goes up. Next-generation protein isn’t about creating more—it’s about making meat better. It lets us provide for a growing and wealthier world without contributing to deforestation or emitting methane. It also allows us to enjoy hamburgers without killing any animals.” He then states that “… lab-grown meat improves our quality of life.” In the article itself, Gates goes on to say that, on one hand, the “problem is that people aren’t likely to stop eating meat anytime soon. Which means lab-grown and plant-based alternatives might be the best way to limit the destruction” – however, he then says that on the other hand, the “drawback of lab-grown meat is that the environmental benefits are still sketchy at best—a recent World Economic Forum report says the emissions from lab-grown meat would be only around 7% less than emissions from beef production.” Is Gates correct? Does lab-grown meat really offer few environmental benefits when compared to animal agriculture? We at vegconomist asked a couple of clean meat specialists for their expert opinions… Paul Shapiro author of the Washington Post bestseller “Clean Meat: How Growing Meat Without Animals Will Revolutionize Dinner and the World”, said to vegconomist; “I do suspect that calling the eco-benefits of clean meat “sketchy at best” is just not true. The evidence is very strong that culturing animal cells is better for the planet than raising and slaughtering whole animals.” Shapiro quotes his recent Medium article , Creating Clarity in the Cultured Meat Climate Confusion – “The reality is that while it’s still too early to predict what cultured meat production may look like at scale, and while nothing is certain, under nearly all scenarios it’ll better for the climate than how we currently produce meat.” Benjamina Bollag, CEO and founder of cellular agriculture firm Higher Steaks, responded as follows: “The carbon footprint and environmental benefit of cell-based meat will be subject to continuing innovation to create circular energy loops in which energy and resource loss is limited from the system. For example, water recycling, intelligent use of land, use of waste products to fuel production of materials required for cell-based meat production. The truth is that additional work is needed to confirm or refute the research that has been carried out in the area so far.” “As a cell-based meat company, we understand that there are clear and obvious benefits to producing cell based meat e.g. decreased use of land, decreased risk of disease transmission through strained factory farming slaughter house practices.” (e.g. 22 hogs are killed per minute at JBS SA). “We believe that while additional work needs to be carried out both to refine the figures for the environmental benefits of cell-based meat and to innovate to maximise the energy and re-use of waste efficiency of cell-based meat, for the many other clear reasons that cell-based meat has a positive impact on our treatment of animals and world health – it is certainly worthy of our effort.” The debate continues…    "

13242,On a Mission to Create Slaughter-Free Meat: Prof. Dr Mark Post on Food Grown From Cells,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/on-a-mission-to-create-slaughter-free-meat-prof-dr-mark-post-on-food-grown-from-cells/,2019-02-22,"The Dutch food technology company Mosa Meat created the world’s first hamburger without slaughtering an animal. By using cell-culture technologies, the company grows cow cells to produce real meat that is not only better for animals and the environment but also delicious and able to meet the world’s growing hunger for meat. In this interview, Chief Scientific Officer, Prof. Mark Post, addresses some of the controversies surrounding this new approach to food and gives us an idea of what to expect.  Prof. Post, you will be one of the keynote speakers at the New Food Conference. Why do you support the concept of the conference and what can the audience expect from your talk at the event?
So far, there has been no relevant conference on customer acceptance of plant-based and cultured protein in Europe. Yet the time is ripe – companies and startups all around the world are pushing the development forward and it’s time to invite a broader audience along for the journey. With the main focus on consumer acceptance, the New Food Conference will contribute to shaping the European landscape as well as raising positive media attention and public awareness around the issue. By bringing together international stakeholders from the food industry, along with startups, investors, and scientists, as well as the media and politicians, the conference creates a platform for networking, exchange, and critical discussions – all essential elements for the successful promotion of a business. In my talk, I will focus on the latest scientific developments in the clean-meat sector as well as the challenges we need to address. How strongly will these ‘novel foods’ shape the future of food?
I wholeheartedly believe that we will move further away from farmed-animal products in the future. More and more consumers are coming to the understanding that the planet simply does not have enough resources to feed an estimated 10 billion people with conventional meat products. Individuals are becoming more conscious about the impacts of their food choices and are seeking out alternatives. As such, there is a rising demand for cruelty-free options. Such options will constitute the future of our eating habits, and cultivated animal products will contribute their fair share. We are confident that once the product is of high enough quality and competitively priced, the benefits will appeal to a wide range of consumers. You say that clean meat has a better ecological footprint than conventional meat products. How much does a clean meat burger save in terms of greenhouse gases and water usage compared to a beef burger? What other benefits are there over conventional animal agriculture?
There are still only a few studies of cultured products, made on assumptions of the future means of production, but the potential benefits of cellular agriculture are promising. Current projections expect that cultured meat production will use up to 96% less water and generate 96% less greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock and the area needed to grow feed crops currently take up large amounts of land, which leads to mass deforestation and subsequently to a drastic loss of biodiversity. Cultured products are expected to use up to 99% less land. Additionally, cultured meat does not require chemicals such as pesticides and fertilisers and will take place in a closed system, where run-off does not enter the environment. Can clean meat be considered cruelty-free?
Improving animal welfare is one of the main reasons we started Mosa Meat, and our meat does not involve cruelty to animals. The initial stage of production requires a cell sample from a donor animal. This is done by a biopsy under anaesthesia and does not cause harm to the animal. A single cell sample can create up to 10,000 kg of cultured meat, which means that those biopsies will not have to be taken very often. Additionally, researchers are working on the development of immortalised cell lines that can be multiplied almost limitlessly to reduce the number of samplings even further. One of the biggest challenges in the development of cultured meat is to find a replacement for fetal bovine serum, a component derived from fetal cows and most commonly used in tissue engineering. Since it is incompatible with our animal welfare standards, we have established a process with a serum-free medium that we are currently optimising. International health organisations recommend limited meat consumption due to its potential to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and colorectal cancer. Since clean meat is molecularly the same as livestock meat, do you expect similar downsides for clean-meat products in terms of health?
In general, we expect to see health benefits of cultured meat over livestock. While the meat we are working on will be identical to livestock products, it doesn’t require antibiotics, steroids, tranquilisers, or genetic modifications. Additionally, due to it being produced in a sterile environment there will be a lower risk of bacterial contaminations. We also believe that, if there is public demand for it, it may be possible to further increase some health aspects of clean meat, such as reducing the amount of fat tissue and replacing saturated fatty acids with omega-3-fatty acids. This would be beneficial for our cholesterol levels and, in turn, reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. How has the meat industry reacted towards the concept of clean meat?
They are curious and open to innovation – especially to alternatives that can help to reduce the problematic ‘side effects’ of their products! The meat industry has to recognise that conventional livestock farming won’t be able to meet the world’s growing demand for meat and is thus looking to diversify its range of protein sources. In fact, several animal producers have invested in cellular agriculture start-ups: Tyson Foods and Cargill have invested in Memphis Meats, Bell Food Group in Mosa Meat, and PHW in SuperMeat, to name just a few. We aim to work with meat companies to accelerate the introduction of cultured meat to the global market and make it available as widely and as soon as possible. Is the concept of cultured meat still a dream of the distant future or something that consumers will get to experience soon?
It is a dream that will come true in the foreseeable future: we expect the introduction of cultured meat on a small scale in the next three to four years. Due to its novelty, it will be relatively expensive in the beginning and will most likely be available first at selected gourmet restaurants. But we expect prices to drop significantly within the next decade so that it will be competitive and able to find its place on supermarket shelves next to livestock meat products. Eventually, cultured meat will become more affordable due to its higher production efficiency. Thank you for the interview, Prof. Post.

13250,Cornerstone Group Publishes Report on Sustainable Protein,https://vegconomist.com/studies-and-numbers/cornerstone-group-publishes-report-on-sustainable-protein/,2019-02-20,"Cornerstone Capital Group released a comprehensive new report: “Sustainable Protein: Investing for Impact at the Nexus of Environment, Human Health and Animal Welfare.” Although the report is not fundamentally vegan, it advises on several pertinent areas such as the declining milk consumption and the countries which have issued reduced meat diet guidelines in the past year.  The analysis focuses on the rise of sustainable protein, which due to changes in consumer preferences, growing awareness of environmental damage cause by factory farming, and the advances in agricultural technology. The report points out that red meat and dairy consumption have been steadily declining, while the demand for alternatives have been rapidly growing: vegan, vegetarian, and flexitarian lifestyles are becoming increasingly popular. On a global scale, plant-based foods are the primary source of protein, accounting for nearly 60% of the total protein supply. The report also points out that if the current crop production that is used for animal feed and other uses (such as biofuels) were shifted to direct consumption in countries with high crop uses for non-food uses, like as China and Brazil, that could provide enough calories for the basic needs of 2.4 billion people. Dietary guidelines, especially in European countries, have also started suggesting consuming more plant-based foods and less meat and dairy products. With a rise in demand and need of sustainable protein, there are a wide range of opportunities arising for investors: alternative proteins (advanced plant-based proteins, fermented proteins, and cultured meat), organic foods, and developers of new agricultural technologies, suggests the report.

An agreement in principle has been reached with the PHW Group to offer JUST’s award-winning plant-based egg substitute “JUST Egg” to consumers throughout Europe, in addition to a previously announced manufacturing and distribution agreement with Eurovo Group In the four months since the launch of JUST Egg in September 2018, the company has sold the plant equivalent of three million chicken eggs in the USA, Hong Kong and Singapore, with China also on the company’s roadmap for 2019. TIME magazine named JUST Egg in their “10 Smartest Sustainable Products of 2018” and Fast Company called it one of the “World Changing Ideas” of the year.  “JUST was founded on the conviction that fresh thinking, pioneering innovation and collaboration between start-ups and established companies can change our nutrition system for the better. JUST, the PHW Group and Eurovo will put this idea into practice and enable us to reach countless European consumers,” said Josh Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of JUST. “The PHW Group’s proven expertise in distribution and logistics and its sustained commitment to alternative protein sources have impressed us and we look forward to working with them”. In addition to the distribution agreement with the PHW Group, JUST announced in July 2018 that the Eurovo Group will manufacture the product in Europe. The European distribution of JUST Egg will be taken over jointly by the PHW Group and Eurovo. The first products are expected to be available in the fourth quarter of this year both in gastronomy and in food retailing. "

A representative from Sainsbury’s supermarket said in a statement to the newspaper, that the market for meat products is on the decline, whereas demand for plant-based alternatives is increasing steadily. A Sainsbury’s spokesperson commented to inews: “We’re seeing increasing demand for plant-based products, and with the unstoppable rise of ‘flexitarianism’ in the UK, we are exploring further ways to make popular meat-free options more accessible. “Through this trial, we hope that by placing meat-alternatives within their own dedicated bay in our meat, fish and poultry aisles, our customer’s shopping experience will become even more seamless.” The plant-based buyer for Sainsbury’s, James Hamilton, said to the Telegraph: “We were looking at [as a business] the challenge we face in the future, if we sell less and less meat what do you backfill it with? So we are supplementing our ranges with alternative proteins and plant based ranges. We are interested to see what happened. The general market dynamic is that meat is on the decline. This is a way of giving people more choice and new ideas” Interestingly, Hamilton describes that the aim of this placement is not to appeal to vegans or vegetarians, but to offer a new kind of protein to the rising flexitarian population, mirroring the sentiments of key players in the plant-based and clean meat industries, who often state that flexitarians are the consumer group best focused on. “We are appealing to different people than those who shop in our plant based section.” Plant-based meat and fish alternatives will be stocked alongside animal meat in 20 Sainsbury’s stores from this Sunday.

The burgers smell, taste, and cook like meat and contain 25g vegetable protein per serving, with added B12 vitamin. They are made from oyster mushrooms, pea, wheat and soy proteins, and oats, with added beetroot juice that creates the “bleeding” effect when cooked. Managing Director of Jan Zandbergen, Jochem Versloot commented on the news: “One of our core values is to always go for the best product. Moving Mountains has achieved this with developing one of the most realistic meat alternatives the world has seen. After tasting this burger, we were confident that Moving Mountains is the company to partner with to enter the alternative protein market. With an incredible 25g of plant protein per 6oz burger patty, an unrivalled texture, juiciness and mouthfeel, we believe that this is the product of 2019!”    "

The survey asked 700 chefs from the American Culinary Federation for their ideas on the most popular restaurant concepts for the new year. 64% highlighted plant-based sausages and burgers as a leading trend, while three out of five chefs pointed towards veggie and carb substitutes emerging as new alternatives to traditional starches. “As more consumers follow vegetarian and vegan diets, restaurants are expanding the complex, inventive veggie-centric items on their menus. Think plant-based burgers and sushi that rival their beef and fish counterparts”, said the National Restaurant Association. Other key concepts include a focus on hyper-local and all natural ingredients, as well as clean menus and vegetable-forward cuisine. The environmental sustainability of a restaurant and its commitment to food waste reduction were other important topics which arose from the survey. On the other hand, approximately 67% of chefs surveyed predicted that new cuts of meat would be one of the top food trends, much alike the year previous. The full results of the survey will be available later this month.      "

In the following interview, they give insights into the planning of the conference. This is the first time that the New Food Conference will take place. Can you tell us about the decision to launch this event?
Julia Aumüller: There is as yet no large and internationally relevant conference on customer acceptance of cultured meat and plant-based protein alternatives in Europe. As such, the focus of our event will be consumer acceptance and the design of the European market. We also want to increase media attention and raise public awareness on this issue. Dr Mark Post, the ‘Father of Cultured Meat’, is co-organising the conference together with ProVeg and we look forward to lively networking and critical discussion. Katleen Haefele: ProVeg has been working for many years with large companies in the food industry in the areas of consulting, training, and food labelling, as well as in the food retail and services sectors. With our new ProVeg Incubator project, we are also supporting the latest developments in the areas of plant-based and cultured meat. In addition, we are active at international trade fairs and events where, for example, we organise adventure worlds or provide on-site speakers. In doing so, we have repeatedly found that there is a great need for such a conference in Europe. Who is the conference for?
Katleen Haefele: The New Food Conference addresses the entire industry along the full length of the value chain. We expect the participation of international stakeholders in the food industry, from manufacturers of semi-finished products through to producers and experts in the retail and catering sectors. As this conference focuses on future-oriented topics, another important target group is startups and investors. In addition, the event is also aimed at scientists, the media, and consumer organisations. Can you tell us more about the content?
Julia Aumüller: The first day of the conference will explore plant-based proteins. Euromonitor and well-known nutritionist Hanni Rützler will provide a comprehensive overview of current trends and developments in the European market. Simply V will show how novel ‘cheese’ products can succeed in the market – not just for the vegan target group. We will also engage with a host of innovative startups and talk to experts about how to make plant-based products more attractive to the mainstream in 2019. The day’s events will also cover food labelling, marketing, investment strategies, and European food retailing. The second day is dedicated to cultured animal products and will include world-class speakers Dr  Mark Post of Mosa Meat, Michael Selden of Finless Foods, Hanna Tuomisto of the University of Helsinki, and Arianna Ferrari, who is currently researching for Adelphi Research.

Caroline Zimmer, Founder and Managing Director of E.V.A GmbH, will use the practical example of the Simply V brand to show how an encounter with a novel ‘cheese treat’ can bring about a paradigm shift in the dairy industry, while Jonas Mårtensson, Head of Product Development and Chef at MAX, Sweden’s oldest burger chain, will show that sustainable concepts can also be implemented in the food service sector. Highlights on 22 March – Cell-Based Proteins
On the second day of the conference, Dr Mark Post from Mosa Meat will take a look at the technologies used in the field of cultivated meat, where growth and innovation have been remarkable in recent years. Michael Selden, Managing Director of Finless Foods, will talk about cell-based fish alternatives and present various research methods in the field. In the panel ‘But what about the farmers?’, Hanna Tuomisto, together with experts and farmers, will discuss the impact of clean meat on traditional agriculture, as well as the opportunities it will provide. Annie Osbourne from the US-based Good Food Institute will explore the advantages and disadvantages of insects as a future protein source.

13425,The Modern Agriculture Foundation: “We Work Towards a New Food System.”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/the-modern-agriculture-foundation-we-work-towards-a-new-food-system/,2018-12-14,"Everyone is talking about clean meat and plant-based meat alternatives. But before these topics become mainstream, we need people that build bridges between several sectors. This is exactly what ‘The Modern Agriculture Foundation’ is doing on a daily basis. The Non-Profit-Organization from Israel connects entrepreneurs and founders, politics, research institutes and investors to make the dream of clean and plant-based meat come true. We wanted to know more about this mission and interviewed Daniela Kurz (Marketing and Communications Director) about MAF.  What is the goal of your organization?
The Modern Agriculture Foundation (MAF) is working towards a food system that produces healthy, sustainable and affordable food without harming animals or the environment. We are a nonprofit organization founded by animal and environmental activists in Israel. Our mission is to promote research and development in the field of clean and plant-based alternatives to meat, eggs and dairy products. The great advantage of Israel as a startup nation is the concentration of many talented entrepreneurs with a population and area comparable to the size of the San Francisco Bay Area. In this hotbed of innovation, science and technology, we’re committed to developing a significant, clean and plant-based protein hub. Our work has already resulted in 4 startups in the field of clean meat, including Supermeat. Which projects are you currently working on?
Universities are an essential part of our work. There, you find talents who could potentially important alternatives to animal products. We organize lectures and courses on alternative proteins. Thus, students receive the necessary education and are also thrilled to participate in research and development in this area. We have already organized an international conference and are planning another one. We also raise awareness in the public and in different sectors, so everyone gets familiar with the topic. We also support startups who work on plant-based and clean alternatives. It is also important for us to work closely with Europe in this area. That’s why we are planning to set up another branch of the Foundation there. How do you finance yourself?
So far, we have been funded by small and medium-sized donations from individuals who identify with the cause. You are looking for sponsors, for which projects?
We plan to launch a clean fish research project, promote interesting startups producing plant-based animal products, and hold another international conference in Israel. In order to be able to realize these projects, we would have to fully hire a CEO who would be responsible for coordinating these projects. We are therefore urgently seeking funding for the salary of this full time employee and hope to find sponsors in Europe. What role will Clean Meat play globally in the food sector in 20 years?
Within 20 years, we hope that clean and plant-based meat will be a significant contributor to the current meat market. Our goal is to make the best possible contribution by using the invaluable resources of our small country has to offer to create healthy, sustainable and cruelty-free food for the whole world.    "
13442,State of Plant-based Industry in Netherlands,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/state-of-plant-based-industry-in-netherlands/,2018-12-07,"The first edition of the National Plantbased Business Monitor has been released. The aim of the monitor is to visualise the status of the plant-based food industry in the Netherlands. It gives an overview of the suppliers of plant-based food who make a difference.  According to research bureau Nielsen, the consumption of plant-based food is growing by double digits. The Green Protein Alliance reports that sales of meat substitutes in the Netherlands increased by 17 percent in 2017. And Distrifood reports that the turnover of meat substitutes increased by 27.4 percent in the first half of 2018. Major players such as Danone and Nestlé have made strategic acquisitions of plantbased food companies. Supermarkets are also offering State of the Plantbase Industry NL more and more shelf space for plant-based alternatives. And several Dutch cultivated meat companies, although not plant-based but also listed because of the benefits for humans, animals and the environment, have raised millions of rounds of funding in the past year.

13525,Olivia Fox Cabane: “Passionate about Finding Alternative Proteins That Could Sustain Nine Billion People”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/olivia-fox-cabane-passionate-about-finding-alternative-proteins-that-could-sustain-nine-billion-people/,2018-11-12,"Olivia Fox Cabane is the former Director of Innovative Leadership for Stanford StartX, the current Chair of the International Alliance for Alternative Protein, and the bestselling author of ‘The Charisma Myth‘. In addition to being a keynote speaker and executive coach to the leadership of Fortune 500 companies such as Google, MGM and Deloitte, she lectures at Harvard, Yale, MIT and the United Nations.  Olivia’s work in creating the New Protein Landscape has been highly influential in the industry and she chairs The International Alliance for Alternative Protein (IAAP). vegconomist was delighted to have the opportunity to speak with Olivia about her work and that of the IAAP, an additionally The Alternative Protein Show which will take place in January 2019. Please tell us about the International Alliance for Alternative Protein and your work.
The International Alliance for Alternative Protein (IAAP) brings together all of the players in the new protein industry: CPG manufacturers using plants, algae, fungi, or cellular agriculture as their protein source; Ingredient suppliers of fragrances, flavors, fillers, shelf-life extenders, etc; Technology & processing partners; Incubators & Accelerators; Nonprofits, Research & Academia; Venture Capital funds investing in this new industry; and Corporate venture partners (the venture arm of a larger entity). The IAAP provides its members with strong tools for connection, collaboration, and marketing exposure within this exploding industry. How do you envisage the future of protein?
We all know that our current food system, in particular our protein production system, is not just unsustainable, it’s horrific. The damage that animal agriculture is doing to the environment is just the tip of the iceberg. That’s why so many of us are passionate about finding alternative proteins that could sustain nine billion people in a healthy, humane, and environmentally responsible way. There is a tipping point, beyond which “alternative” becomes “mainstream.” I believe that the day we match traditional protein sources on taste and beat them on price, we will have reached that tipping point. It can’t happen soon enough. What has been the most exciting development in cellular agriculture or alt protein in your experience?
Without a doubt, it’s the incredible speed at which this industry is exploding. Just look at two Landscapes side by side; the first one – the very first – is from february of this year, the second is from seven months later. I have never seen an industry grow at such an extraordinary rate. The second most remarkable development is the amount of interest in funding. When was the last time you saw an industry with twice as many VCs trying to give money away, as there are companies to accept it? Forget social media; if you’re a young entrepreneur, alt-protein is where you should be. It’s a trillion dollar market begging to be disrupted. The third point is simply the quality of the people who are entering this field. We’re not talking high-school or college dropouts; we’re talking highly accomplished doctors, biologists, engineers and successful entrepreneurs. Who at present are the key players in protein / alternative protein?
The New Protein Landscape is divided into three main groups: entities that are creating alternative proteins, entities that are supporting this creation, and entities that are funding the whole process. Within the “creating” category, you’ll find a first subdivision of CPG vs ingredients, and within CPG, a further subdivision between plant-based and cell-based protein. Within the “supporting” category, we find processing & technology partners, incubators & accelerators, nonprofits, and research & academia. The “funding” category separates VC firms from the venture arms of large corporations and the venture / investment arms of government agencies. This ecosystem is further supported by media, events, and service providers. What do you expect from The Alternative Protein Show in January
The Alternative Protein Show (January 15th-17th, 2019) is a great big networking event where all the entities on the New Protein Landscape are invited so they can all meet each other. Just like in the map, there will be different areas for plant-based and cell-based protein, ingredients, technology, incubators & accelerators, NGOs, VC funds, government agencies and more. Pre-Event Workshop: If you’re from outside the US, this is a great opportunity to learn fundraising, the Silicon Valley way. You’ll receive the abbreviated version of a curriculum developed for Stanford StartX international entrepreneurs. This session will cover the art and the science of making great first impressions, body language and behavior, how to pitch VCs in Silicon Valley: everything from what to wear to how, exactly, to shake hands, and much, much more. Wednesday January 16th: On the upper level, join any one of the many sessions dedicated to deep-dives into various areas of business, science & industry. On the lower level, network with hundreds of people in the industry, make connections you can follow up on later. Here is just a sample of the companies attending: Thursday January 17th: More than a dozen Silicon Valley venture capital firms have reserved time in their partners’ schedules specifically to meet with visiting startups, and you’ll be able to sign up to meet them via online calendar. This is your chance to schedule follow-up meetings with all the people you’ve met at the speed-dating show. Who can get involved in this event or learn more about the work of the IAAP?
We will be building the IAAP to be an international trade organization offering: – An interactive map of the new protein landscape and its subsets, meat and dairy (soon to be live at newprotein.org)
– A job board and career portal to help solve the dearth of technical talent many alt-protein startups are currently facing
– A signature annual summit and expo, designed specifically for networking and product demonstration
– Directories of all alliance members, event attendees, etc segmented by country, funding status…
– An educational component of both general knowledge (leadership & marketing skills, etc.) and special knowledge (latest advances in tissue culture) We welcome involvement from all the people in and around the alt-protein industry, whether you’re a student, a startup, a nonprofit or a large company.

13559,Right Treat: “There Is No Doubt the Impact Will Be Immense”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/right-treat-there-is-no-doubt-the-impact-will-be-immense/,2018-10-31,"David Yeung is the Founder & CEO of Right Treat, and also launched Green Monday, a social venture with the mission to tackle climate change, food insecurity and public health. His work in the field of sustainability and innovation has earned him the award of “Social Entrepreneur of the Year” by the World Economic Forum and Schwab Foundation. Other honors and recognitions include “Ten Outstanding Young Persons Hong Kong,” “50 Most Innovative Companies” and “Idea of the Year.” Mr Yeung founded Right Treat, based in Hong Kong, which addresses the sustainability issues caused by the immense consumption of pork in Asia; an estimated 1.29 billion metric tonnes of waste is produced by the Chinese pork industry per year alone. Right Treat have labelled pork as “An Industry Overdue for Disruption” and aim to do so with their innovation. vegconomist spoke with Mr Yeung about Omnipork, sustainability, and the recent UN environmental awards which recognised his peers Beyond Meat and Impssible Foods. Can you introduce OmniPork, what was the motivation behind your launch?
My motivation behind founding Green Monday, Green Common and now Omnipork is to shift the world towards a healthier and more sustainable food system. Given we are based in Asia, and given Asia has the highest population in the world, we channel our understanding of Asian meat consumption to a product innovation that is not yet available and has the potential to be a game-changer in our market. That innovation is called Omnipork. When and where will Omnipork be available?
Omnipork is already available in Hong Kong at various hotels and restaurants. For example, the Chinese restaurants in Grand Hyatt, Royal Garden Hotel, Cordis Hotel already feature Omnipork in their signature dishes. Meanwhile, local names such as “Food Expression,” “King of Sheng Jian”, “Meat Pie Gor” are the ones that really relate to the Hong Kong locals. They are introducing exciting Omnipork dishes that cater to local palettes and immediately receive overwhelmingly positive feedback. As for outside of Hong Kong, we are already working with restaurants in Singapore and Macau and the launch will come in November. Finally, fans in Hong Kong have been eagerly waiting for the retail pack for them to bring home and work their own culinary magic. That will launch in December in Hong Kong. What differentiates Omnipork from other meat substitute products?
Omnipork is unique in terms of being an extremely versatile pork alternative innovation that works magic in Asian (and global) cuisines, with infinite applications. Asian chefs and households use pork in a very different way, pretty much as a base ingredient that can somehow be incorporated in every dish, rather than as a finished product such as pork cutlet, bacon, ham or sausage. Yet it is universally known that pork is high in fat, cholesterol and calories (not to mention antibiotics and hormone nowadays), so to have a plant-based alternative that is healthier but equally versatile is music to both chefs and consumers. Relatively speaking, Western companies focus more on chicken and beef because that’s their main source of protein. How much interest is currently shown in your product by restaurants and retail?
It has been overwhelming and extremely exciting. Asian chefs and households have been craving for innovations they can “play” with and apply their creativity and imagination. Could you comment on the recent UN awards for Impossible and Beyond – what impact might this have on the cultured meat industry?
First of all, my heartfelt congratulations to Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods for the award. They are true pioneers and beacons that absolutely deserve the recognition. Yet on a macro level, the message doesn’t get louder or clearer than to have the highest, most credible authority in the world to come out and tell people that the meat industry and the food system is not sustainable and a shift in diet is essential to the fundamental survival of the planet and humanity. No question it will stimulate further much-needed shift in both supply and demand. Your website says that 65% of meat consumed in China is pork. What kind of difference in terms of animal life and sustainability does your product have the potential to achieve?
Just in China alone we are talking about over 700 million pigs, and as we speak there is an African swine fever going on in multiple provinces in China, claiming away tens of thousands of hog lives. Meanwhile, the manure from the hog industry is one of the biggest source of water pollution. We can talk for hours just on this subject but there is no doubt the impact will be immense. Which consumer group are you targeting? Is the primary focus the Asian market?
Asia has the world biggest population, and Asian food and meat industry is long overdue for innovation and disruption. People are also becoming much more food safety conscious and health conscious. The meat industry has an enormous carbon footprint. How does the production of Omnipork compare to this?
Just like majority of plant-based innovations, Omnipork should have a massive improvement in terms of carbon footprint, water footprint, land use efficiency, and water pollution. Are you planning to introduce more varieties, e.g. OmniBeef, OmniChicken?
Even just with pork alone, there are many more applications and possibilities that are not yet explored, and that’s what our team is focusing on right now. Where do you see Right Treat in five years?
This doesn’t just apply to Right Treat. This applies to the entire plant-based industry. For the sake of the planet and humanity, these emerging brands can’t grow fast enough to become major players in the mainstream market. For Right Treat specifically, just penetrating the Asian markets is a tall task. Asia, despite its size, is highly fragmented. Each market has its own language, governance, regulations and cultures. So overcoming the barriers in each local market is by no means easy.    "
13571,Planetarians: “Animal Agriculture Cannot Feed the World”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/planetarians-animal-agriculture-cannot-feed-the-world/,2018-10-26,"Aleh Manchulianstau, food scientist and co-founder of Planetarians, is tackling the challenge of feeding the planet’s rapidly expanding population through a process he refers to as “upcycling de-fatted seeds.” His secret ingredient is sunflower oilcake; he believes that repurposing this by-product into human food can provide consumers with a cheap, clean, sustainable source of plant-based protein, and add value to supplier profits.  Planetarians have a unique product which offers a solution to some of the many sustainability issues we currently face. De-fatted seeds are traditionally fed to cattle, however they actually have more protein (35%) by weight than can be obtained from beef (26%). De-fatted seeds are the dry matter remaining after oil extraction from crops grown for their oil, such as sunflower, canola, cotton seeds, etc. Aleh says that this is a highly sustainable product, as on average, 20 pounds of defatted seeds are created for every gallon of extracted oil. We spoke to him about his vision. First of all, please can you introduce your brand and say how you got started?
We’re a team of food and culinary scientists and engineers. Previously we formulated and sold more than 1 million servings of nutritionally complete meals. Sourcing ingredients for our new product line we stumbled upon de-fatted seeds. De-fatted seeds are the dry matter that’s left after oil extraction from crops grown for their oil, such as sunflower, canola, cotton seeds, etc. But, animal agriculture cannot feed the world. It already occupies 80% farmland, providing only 20% calories. If you go to any business school – you will be advised to do the opposite. In addition to the growing population, healthy choices and concerns about climate change drive prices for plant-based proteins. Please explain de-fatted seeds and their benefits.
De-fatted seeds are the dry matter that’s left after oil extraction. On average, 40% of the sunflower seed turns into the de-fatted seed. Sunflower possesses many properties that make it an appealing alternative protein source from both a marketing and formulation perspective, including its low cost, absence of major allergens, low antitrypsin inhibitors, and its status as vegan and “clean” label friendly. Unlike expensive isolated proteins ($4-8/lb), Planetarians developed a cost-effective method of manufacturing sunflower protein preparations that appeal senses at the price of all-purpose flour $0.5/lb. Our ingredients are allergen-free, and Non-GMO, unlike soy-based proteins, are five times cheaper than pea protein and a good source of fibre. Your company seems to be focused on sustainability – can you say a little to this, why this is an imperative issue to address and what impact could products like yours have on the problem at hand?
Many people know that 40% of our food is wasted, but nobody mentions that before animal products even reach consumers’ plates, animal agriculture has already lost 90% of the calories used as inputs to produce them… From the initial 100% of the calories in the de-fatted seeds, humans get only 17% of that number of calories if we feed de-fatted seeds to poultry and then consume poultry. We get 9% of that total if we feed defatted seeds to pigs and then consume pork, and 3% of that total when we feed de-fatted seeds to cows, and then consume the beef. Repurposing de-fatted sunflower seeds from animal to human consumption has the potential of feeding the growing population while simultaneously reducing the impact on the planet. How much interest is currently shown in your product by retail chains?
We got requests for samples from many retailers (WholeFoods, Safeway, Hy-vee, just to name a few), but as we mentioned already, we’re a ingredient tech company. Brands selling products in the mentioned chains are our primary clients. I cannot disclose the names at this moment, but you may check Twitter for some public endorsements from executives of large multinational corporations. Which sales channels do you currently use for marketing, and why?
Mostly trade shows and industry media. We showcased our ingredients at Food Waste Summit at Harvard, Fancy Food Show in New York and IFT 2018 in Chicago this summer. We presented opportunities to right a wrong in agriculture at the Ag Innovation Showcase in St. Louis, and in industry media such as Food Navigator and National Sunflower Association magazine. I would be glad to meet some of your readers at the Circular Economy event during Verge in Oakland, Naturally Boulder annual event or SupplySide West in Las Vegas this fall. What is your company mission or what are you striving for? 
Our goal: 100% sunflower cake into food production by 2040. Everybody deserves quality nutrition. Bioinformatics allowed us to identify the new sources of protein along with traditional meat. Health benefits, concerns about the growing population and climate change set plant-based proteins on rapid growth. Fortification of the conventional products with protein such as bars, cookie, pasta, etc. offers a new variety of energy sources for customers. Once the customers get access to affordable protein from bread-like products, the necessity for animal products will be significantly reduced. How do you view the future of plant-based ingredients such as yours?
Plant-based proteins will become the primary energy source for the forthcoming generations. In my opinion, animal products will become niche products for pleasure. Do you have any new products in development?
At present we are focusing on sunflower products. We invite all researchers to collaborate on other oily crops such as rape/canola, cotton seed, palm kernel meal, copra meal, etc. If you’re a food company thinking of using sustainable ingredients –  let’s talk – we may want to support you. Where do you see yourselves in five years as a company?
In five years we see ourselves as a world platform for upcycled ingredients from oily crops. Successful farmers, different ingredients, free recipes, a trusted brand, and for sure – with many happy customers, who obtain access to affordable protein.    "

This week, Tyson (which kills 6,000,000 chickens, 30,000 cattle, and 48,000 pigs every day), have stated on their blog that “sustainability is at the core of all we do.”  Tyson have been branching out into plant-based proteins and invested in Beyond Meat and Memphis Meats, in addition to launching their own brand plant-based line Green Street. The blog post, which was published following the Good Food conference, states: “Not everyone at the Good Food Conference was happy to see representatives from the largest producer of animal protein in the U.S. And that’s okay. To thrive and adapt to consumer trends, new industries need competition and, well, a little controversy. But in the end, there’s common ground between us and those who don’t always support our business —the need to feed our growing world population more sustainably.” Tyson CFO Tom Mastrobuoni continues, “We believe that alternative proteins, whether from plants or the lab, can co-exist with traditional animal protein,” and adds, “Sustainability is at the core of all we do: we’re the world’s largest producer of no-antibiotics-ever chicken. This spring we set a two-million-acre land stewardship target. We have a goal to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2030. And investing in alternative proteins is also essential to that sustainability strategy.” With a possible nod to some of the controversy surrounding Tyson, Mastrobuoni acknowledges; “We don’t have all the answers. Nobody does. But we’re willing to participate in our own disruption by investing in alternative proteins, focusing on long-term sustainability and working to provide consumers with the products they want.”      "
13704,Report by Adam Smith Institute: Does Laboratory Meat Have Potential to Prevent Food Crisis?,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/report-by-adam-smith-institute-does-laboratory-meat-have-potential-to-prevent-food-crisis/,2018-09-19,"Humanity is currently using natural resources 1.7 times faster than the planet’s ecosystems can regenerate, and has already used up all the resources naturally available this year. A new Adam Smith Institute report suggests that laboratory meat has the potential to save lives and the environment, and to prevent a food crisis. Researcher Jamie Hollywood, and president of the Adam Smith Institute, Dr Madsen Pirie, have written a report on meat grown from cells in the laboratory, also known as cultured meat or clean meat. This cellular agriculture has the potential to greatly benefit the environment. Dr. Madsen Pirie says, “This will free up millions of acres of grazing land for other purposes. It will also solve all ethical questions related to the rearing and slaughtering of animals.” Due to an increase in meat consumption of over 330 percent, large areas will soon be devoted to meat production which could feed many more people if used to grow crops. Furthermore, greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture would be reduced by 78-96%, as 99% less land would be used. Other reasons for the report include the threat of food poisoning and an antibiotic resistance crisis due to factory farming. Both could be reduced or even eliminated by clean laboratory meat, as production takes place under controlled conditions. The advantages and the potential of clean laboratory meat have also been recognized by companies such as the American start-up JUST and the meat producer Tyson. JUST has announced that it will launch Clean Meat in the form of chicken later this year, and Tyson has invested 2.2 million US dollars in the Israeli Clean Meat start-up Future Meat Technologies.

A few months ago, Matthias Rohra from ProVeg spoke to us about this project in an interview. The internationally active food organization ProVeg aims to advance the veggie market with this initiative, and to actively promote further research into and market launches of products like cultivated meat, eggs and dairy. “With the ProVeg Incubator, we are supporting founders who want to fundamentally change the veggie market with new plant-based and cultivated meat, fish, milk and egg alternatives, as well as veggie services, and help to shape the future of our diets. The ProVeg Incubator provides them with optimal conditions for a successful business venture,” says Sebastian Joy, ProVeg Managing Director. As part of its search for innovative business ideas, ProVeg will offer new companies modern office space, along with expert networks and funding opportunities. It aims to provide optimal support to new ventures. Sebastian Joy explains, “Many start-ups which want to react to the increasing demand for new veggie products find it difficult to enter successfully into the market. Often they lack financial resources, economic know-how and the corresponding infrastructure. The ProVeg Incubator supports company founders during the development of their products, and with all further steps towards a successful market entry.” Up-to-date information is available at www.proveg.com/incubator and on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/provegincubator/ New company founders, along with anyone who is already working on exciting new food or product projects, can apply for the incubator program at https://proveg.com/application-form/    "
13771,Study Shows Clean Meat is Attracting Increasing Interest in the USA,https://vegconomist.com/market-and-trends/study-shows-clean-meat-is-attracting-increasing-interest-in-the-usa/,2018-09-04,"Cultured meat, synthetic meat or clean meat – laboratory meat produced from animal cells – now has many names. The latest results of a representative survey in the USA have shown that the term “clean meat” is best received by consumers. According to studies by the Good Food Institute (GFI), 66 percent of Americans are already prepared to try clean meat. These are encouraging results for startups such as JUST or Memphis Meats, which are active in Clean Meat research and development.   The study, financed by the Animal Charity Evaluators, showed further interesting results. Approximately 53 percent of consumers would consume cultured meat as a substitute for conventional meat, with 46 percent even stating that they would be prepared to use clean meat on a regular basis. Over half of respondents said that laboratory-grown meat is healthier than conventional meat and that they believe it will taste good. The results show that consumer attitudes towards cellular cultivation have changed dramatically since more information was made available. An increasing proportion of the American population is becoming aware of the extent to which laboratory meat can promote environmental protection and, above all, where the differences to conventional meat lie. In the survey, 73 percent of the participants said they were convinced that Clean Meat was more environmentally friendly than animal products. It even turned out that consumers who received explicit information about the living conditions of animals on farms were inclined to pay more money for cultivated meat.    "
13796,[Business Insiders] Washington Post Bestselling Author Paul Shapiro about Clean Meat,https://vegconomist.com/business-insiders/business-insiders-washington-post-bestselling-author-paul-shapiro-about-clean-meat/,2018-08-28,"For the next installment of our Expert Opinion section we are delighted to present a guest post from Paul Shapiro, author of the Washington Post bestselling book Clean Meat: How Growing Meat Without Animals Will Revolutionize Dinner and the World, experienced TEDx speaker, co-host of the Business for Good Podcast, and well-known advocate for animal rights and food sustainability.  Paul is a member of the Animal Rights Hall of Fame and founded Compassion over Killing in 1995. In his role as expert and author on the issue of clean meat, we invited Paul to share some of his knowledge, and here we have his special post for vegconomist on this interesting subject. High Steaks Regulations for the Clean Meat Industry A recent FDA listening session examining the nascent field of start-ups growing real meat from animal cells—rather than raising entire animals—highlighted a federal food fight with outcomes that could affect just how millions of us eat. Three years ago, there wasn’t a single company growing “clean meat,” so-named both as a nod to clean energy and because of its food safety benefits. (In fact, the first reference to this name for this food was in a 2008 Times letter.) Today, there are more than a dozen such startups and they’re attracting capital not only from Silicon Valley but from the heartland as well. For example, clean meat start-up Memphis Meats—whose clean duck meat I’ve sampled and enjoyed—has earned investment from meat giants Tyson and Cargill. To be clear, these companies aren’t making alternatives to meat. Many innovative companies, like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, are already on the market and producing plant-based meats that look and taste like animal meat but originate in the plant kingdom. The clean meat companies, in contrast, are making real meat simply by growing actual animal cells into the same muscle they’d become if they were still inside the animal’s body. If a clean meat industry is allowed to flourish, it’s possible that concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) that are responsible for so many environmental problems could be outcompeted in similar ways to how the rise of digital photography left Kodak a relic of a quaint past. That’s because it takes many fewer resources to grow animal muscle than to produce the entire beast. One 2011 study by Oxford University’s Hanna Tuomisto concluded that growing beef without the cow could use 99 percent less land and 96 percent less water while emitting 96 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than the beef we eat today. Admittedly, life cycle analyses are likely to be revised as we get closer to actual commercialization of clean meat, but it’s clear that in the same way clean energy competes against fossil fuels, clean meat may soon compete with factory farms. While no clean meat is yet on the market, the FDA recently told CNN, “Given information we have at the time, it seems reasonable to think that cultured meat, if manufactured in accordance with appropriate safety standards and all relevant regulations, could be consumed safely.” This is one reason that food safety watchdogs like Dr. Michael Jacobson, co-founder of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, are enthusiastic about clean meat. “It’s a good way to have animal products that would be a lot safer to consume and more sustainable to produce,” Jacobson observes. “I’d be happy to eat it.” But regardless of which agency ultimately oversees clean meat producers, that agency should seek to welcome rather than stifle innovation and competition in the protein space. As our population continues to grow and consume more meat, meeting that demand with clean meat — and of course plant-based meat as well — is a path toward helping sustainably feed ourselves into the future.

13815,Canada: Fast Food Turning to Veganism,https://vegconomist.com/hot-off-the-vegan-press/canada-fast-food-turning-to-veganism/,2018-08-23,"Yesterday Canadian publication CBC reported on the gradual transformation of fast food in Canada with a current lean towards plant-based products both in fast food outlets and in supermarket goods. CBC report that the fast food industry is now catering to the “One-in-ten Canadian diners who identify as vegetarian or vegan by adding an increasing array of alternative proteins to their menus.” The report says that consumers are turning towards alternative proteins partly due to high meat prices, environmental, and health factors, but conclude that the “The main impetus for the trend is the improvement in vegetarian and vegan options.” CBC highlight the fact that the meat industry are also venturing into plant-based foods, with companies such as Lightlife Foods, who were acquired by Maple Leaf, now offering nine products in Canadian grocery stores. It cites that “About seven per cent of Canadians consider themselves vegetarians and 2.3 per cent identify as vegans — levels that were not previously known.” This comes just weeks after the research published by Dalhousie University stated that the number of vegans and vegetarians in Canada now exceeds 3 million.

13885,New study: “Clean Meat is the Future of the Meat Industry”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/new-study-clean-meat-is-the-future-of-the-meat-industry/,2018-08-07,"Clean meat is a seriously interesting topic which has generated massive amounts of publicity and debate in recent months, with biotech startups and cultured meat manufacturers such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods creating mass interest and global coverage with their brands of “bleeding” burgers. Faunalytics, a nonprofit research organization, recently conducted a study with the support of researchers from the University of Bath and the Good Food Institute, amongst others, called Messages to Overcome Naturalness Concerns in Clean Meat Acceptance: Primary Findings. Here we have the first interview with one of the research team regarding these enlightening insights.  The results of this groundbreaking study which can be found here, showed that 66% of people were willing to try clean meat, 53% were willing to eat clean meat as a replacement for conventional meat, and 46% were willing to buy it regularly. But what are the further implications and what impact will clean meat have on the meat industry? Chris Bryant, Doctoral Researcher from the University of Bath, explains. Please briefly explain what is “clean meat” for any readers who are unaware.
Clean meat is real meat grown from animal cells rather than by rearing animals. It is identical to conventional meat, but it can be produced without the ethical and environmental implications of raising animals for slaughter. Clean meat is not available commercially yet, but it is likely that we will see it in supermarkets within a few years. Why is clean meat important and necessary at this point in time?
There are three main benefits of clean meat. First, it means animal products without the animals, so less animal suffering and slaughter. Second, clean meat is far less damaging to the environment compared to conventional meat. And third, it addresses a lot of the public health concerns about foodborne infections and antibiotic abuse in animal agriculture. How do people feel about lab-cultured food according to your study? What are the potential dangers if any?
On the whole, the findings were remarkably positive for clean meat! About two thirds of participants said they would be willing to try clean meat, and over half were willing to eat it instead of conventional meat. We originally set up this study to investigate ways of addressing consumer concerns about naturalness, but we found that for most Americans, this was not a big concern! It seems that people recognise the benefits of clean meat, and most are willing to make the switch. There are many safety benefits of clean meat. Being produced in a clean facility means that it eliminates the risk of salmonella, e coli, and other foodborne diseases commonly found in conventional meat. Of course, food safety will be the number one concern for regulators, and rightly so. Robust regulation will play a big role in ensuring public trust in clean meat. Is clean meat aimed towards vegans or meat-eaters primarily?

Clean meat is for people who want to eat meat! Most vegetarians and vegans say they would not eat it, but to be frank, that is not terribly important. They already don’t contribute to the problems caused by animal agriculture, so there’s nothing to be gained from them switching to clean meat! The real benefits come from meat-eaters switching, and because meat-eaters are a much larger market than vegetarians and vegans, this is who the industry will focus on selling to. Clean meat will allow meat-eaters to have their steak and eat it! What, in your opinion, does the future look like for the meat industry?
We have already seen signs that clean meat is the future of the meat industry. Clean meat companies have attracted investments from Bill Gates and Richard Branson – but perhaps most importantly, from a number of huge meat processors including Tyson, Cargill, and Bell Food Group. The players who know the meat industry best of all seem to agree that clean meat is the future. In a few decades, farming animals for meat could be obsolete.  Who are the key players currently in the clean meat market?
There is an ever-growing number of start-ups in the clean meat space. The key players in terms of investment and product development are JUST (formerly Hampton Creek), Memphis Meats, Mosa Meats, Finless Foods, and SuperMeat. These companies, from the U.S., Israel, and the Netherlands, have all attracted multi-million dollar investments. It seems likely that JUST will be the first of these companies to bring a product to market – they say they will be ready by the end of 2018. Why are your findings pertinent to the vegan movement and what do they suggest about veganism moving forward? It has been fantastic to see veganism become increasingly mainstream in the last couple of years, but the truth is that most people are not willing to give up meat. The number one reason (according to the poll reported here) is because they like meat too much. Clean meat, along with other animal products produced using similar methods, will soon be able to give consumers the chance to eat whatever they want without the ethical and environmental cost of doing so. Anything surprising or outstanding from your results that you would like to mention?
The finding that two thirds of Americans would eat clean meat is very similar to another U.S. survey published in 2017. One thing that did surprise us, as researchers interested in overcoming the problem of people seeing clean meat as unnatural, was that most people were not too concerned about this. Clearly, most people saw the benefits of clean meat enough to overcome that reaction! Please feel free to add anything else which may be of interest to our readers.
Regulation of clean meat and other cell-cultured animal products is currently being debated in the U.S. where the Food and Drug Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture are both vying for authority. Most clean meat advocates favour regulation by the FDA – it seems they would be more able to do this, given that they currently regulate over 80% of food in the U.S. including other products produced by cell cultures (such as yeast and mycoproteins). In addition, early iterations used foetal bovine serum as a growth medium, meaning that animal products were still involved in production. This was always going to be a target for change (since using animal products makes the whole endeavour pointless) and many alternatives are now being explored. Most of the main clean meat manufacturers will not be using animal products as a growth serum in the products they bring to market! A related point is on the cells used – some vegans object to clean meat because it still requires cells to be taken from non-consenting animals. Some companies are exploring the possibility of using cell lines which do not need to be replaced (so animals can be taken out of the production system once it is going). JUST recently made clean chicken using a cell taken from the feather of a chicken rather than a biopsy, which is also a cruelty-free alternative!

13886,Amidori: “Right from the Start We Have Focused Strongly on the Catering Sector.”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/amidori-right-from-the-start-we-have-focused-strongly-on-the-catering-sector/,2018-08-07,"The company Amidori proves that vegan meat alternatives do not always have to be made of soya. With a base of sunny pea and oats, the company aims to produce meat alternatives with a firm bite – and to do so in a resource-conserving and environmentally friendly way. We interviewed founder Friedrich Büse about entrepreneurial developments and future plans in this sector. How is your brand developing?
Right from the start, we worked to establish our brand in both B2B and B2C markets. At the moment, our focus is on advancing the B2B business both nationally and internationally. Here we are concentrating on collaborating with companies in the areas of restaurant chains, catering and large food companies. Our customers in these areas include selected Hyatt hotels and IKEA. Our customers in the end-consumer segment now include around 50 retailers spread across Germany, and we are also stocked in more than 250 branches of Coop in Norway. Furthermore, we sell some of our products via the online shop “alles vegetarisch” of AVE (Absolute Vegan Empire). Which products are performing particularly well?
Since we develop individual solutions for the special requirements of our customers in the B2B context, the product characteristics differ significantly from customer to customer depending on their wishes. In the B2C sector, for example, our products “M¡dori® Minced” and “M¡dori® Pulled in Marinade Thyme Garlic” are very popular. What distinguishes your brand from other suppliers in this segment?
We don’t just produce food, we take a holistic approach to everything we do. Of course, the main focus here is on the handling of plant proteins, but social, ethical and ecological aspects always play a central role. Together with our partners – the Fraunhofer IVV, the Emsland Group, various European universities and institutes – we are intensively engaged in topics such as research into innovative technology solutions, suitable seeds, the cultivation of our raw materials in European multi-field farming, and the biological value and bioavailability of the foods we produce. This results, among other things, in access to exclusive know-how and particularly high-quality and safe raw materials, directly from our home market in Europe. From the outset, we have also focused on issues such as raising awareness of healthy eating and actively contributing to reducing food waste and climate change. Under this philosophy, we produce tasty products with a firm bite, based on plant-based proteins. In doing so, we consciously and completely refrain from using soya, the most widely used raw material in our industry. How do you plan to increase brand awareness?
Right from the start, we have focused strongly on the catering sector. With our ever-growing street food fleet, which operates far beyond our region, as well as through collaboration with restaurateurs and established companies in the catering industry, we bring our products closer to consumers without them having to cook them themselves. Since the end of last year, we have also been telling our story via relevant social media platforms and are now also making direct online contact with end consumers. For strategic reasons, we had deliberately held back until now. From 2019, however, we will increase our marketing activities throughout Europe. In order to be able to fully develop these activities, we are in the process of further expanding strong partnerships with European food retailers and other sales partners. What innovations can we expect from you in 2018?
In 2018, you can definitely expect a line extension from us. Surprises will follow in 2019 when we expand our range to include products made from vegetables and fruit. Plant-based meat alternatives versus cultivated meat – is there (in the future) room for both?
Definitely. On the one hand, it will probably be a while before so-called in-vitro-meat comes onto the market at a price acceptable to the consumer and, on the other hand, there will probably always be consumers who do not want to eat animal meat for various reasons. Whether this comes from living animals or a Petri dish does not make any difference to these consumers. Furthermore, the development of plant-based meat alternatives is still relatively new. In the future, there will probably be further leaps in the similarity of the products to meat. If anyone is interested, who can they contact at your company?
For trade in the DACH region, there is a central point of contact at sales@amidori.com with our manager for this area, Mr. Christian Kraus. For international interested parties, the easiest way is to send a message to info@amidori.com – from there the inquiry will find its way to the relevant person.    "
13887,Dr. Bernadette Sütterlin: “The Focus Should Not Be on the Production Method.”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/dr-bernadette-sutterlin-the-focus-should-not-be-on-the-production-method/,2018-08-07,"So far, veganism has meant the absolute renunciation of meat. Thanks to the development of “laboratory meat” (so-called in-vitro meat), this could soon change. But though it sounds simple, most consumers will take some convincing. The research of Dr. Bernadette Sütterlin from the ETH in Zurich, which deals with the sustainability and acceptance of laboratory meat from the consumer’s point of view, also proves this. In this interview, we learned more about reactions to laboratory meat, possible stumbling blocks during its introduction and the future development of this segment.  How do people currently respond to the topic of laboratory meat?
As our studies have shown, acceptance of laboratory meat is currently very low. Compared to conventionally-produced meat, laboratory meat is perceived as more risky, and the willingness to consume cultured meat is very low – about half as high as with conventional meat. Driving forces are the perception of laboratory meat as unnatural and the disgust caused by this. Due to this negative perception, beneficial aspects of laboratory meat, such as greater eco-friendliness and reduced animal suffering, are largely ignored in the assessment. What were the most astonishing results of your studies?
Our study results indicate that the negative perception of laboratory meat in relation to its naturalness can lead to a distorted assessment of the risks. The study participants felt that the risk of developing colon cancer due to high meat consumption was less acceptable for in vitro meat than for conventional meat. This means that identical risks are classified as less acceptable in connection with cultured meat than in connection with conventionally produced meat. The effect cultivated meat has on perceptions of conventional meat is also astonishing. Descriptions of laboratory meat had the paradoxical effect of making people assess conventional meat more positively. In comparison with cultured meat, conventionally produced meat achieved the same high values as organic meat in terms of perceived naturalness and people’s willingness to consume it. Organic, conventional, laboratory meat – what are consumers’ preferences?
For some years now, the trend has generally been towards a more conscious diet. Considerations related to eco-friendliness, health, ethical factors and lifestyle in general are increasingly being incorporated into food choices, and therefore more and more organic food is being consumed. Compared to conventional products, organic products are perceived as more environmentally friendly, healthier and tastier, and their nutritional value is estimated to be higher. As mentioned above, perceived naturalness plays an important role in assessing the risks and benefits of a production method and its acceptance. Organic meat is considered very natural, and conventional meat is somewhere in the midfield. Laboratory meat, on the other hand, is perceived as unnatural and therefore, despite its positive aspects in terms of eco-friendliness and animal welfare, preference is currently being given to organic and then conventional meat. How will laboratory meat be able to assert itself in spite of this?
With new, unfamiliar technologies, consumers tend to be more critical than with familiar technologies, and generally assess the risks as higher and the benefits as lower. Laboratory meat, however, addresses the needs of consumers who do not eat meat for reasons of environmental issues and/or animal welfare, and may be a suitable alternative for them. In vitro meat could also help to meet the growing global demand for meat. If consumers are more familiar with laboratory meat and no longer associate it with unnaturalness, cultured meat could have a promising future. What should suppliers of laboratory meat be aware of in order to create a positive attitude towards their products amongst consumers?
Communication is central to promoting and ensuring acceptance of laboratory meat. Communication in relation to laboratory meat should emphasise its similarities to conventionally-produced meat – both are derived from an animal’s muscle fibres – and focus on positive characteristics such as eco-friendliness and reduced animal suffering. The focus should not be on the production method, as biotechnology is automatically associated with the unnatural, which in turn has a negative effect on judgement and acceptance. When discussing production methods, a non-technical vocabulary that is as neutral as possible must be chosen. Terms such as “laboratory” or “artificial”, which in themselves have negative connotations and create an unnatural perception, should be avoided. Do you think research and the public should have a positive attitude towards in vitro meat?
That depends on the perspective you look at it from. If the aim is to find more environmentally-friendly and animal-friendly meat production methods for existing and potential meat consumers, then in vitro meat is certainly an appropriate alternative. If the view is taken that meat consumption should be generally reduced, whether for environmental, health or ethical reasons, then laboratory meat contributes little to the solution. How will the topic of laboratory meat develop over the next 1 to 3 years?
In addition to technical and regulatory hurdles, there are also some obstacles to consumer acceptance that need to be overcome before laboratory meat can establish itself on the market. At present, acceptance of cultured meat is very low. Because of its perceived unnatural nature, concerns about possible risks predominate and little weight is attached to the benefits. This perception and the convictions associated with it are deeply rooted and can’t be changed easily.    "

13897,Paypal Founder Invests in Pet Biotech Firm Wild Earth,https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/paypal-founder-invests-in-pet-biotech-firm-wild-earth/,2018-08-06,"Biotech startup company Wild Earth has announced a successful round of funding with investment from Pathfinder, which is the investment vehicle of Founders Fund, and Paypal founder Peter Thiel. This round of funding totalled $450,000, meaning that Wild Earth has now received funding to the tune of almost $5 million.  CEO of Wild Earth, Ryan Bethencourt, is part of the self-labelled Vegan Mafia group whose members are former financiers, entrepreneurs and bio-tech investors who have the shared aim of removing animals from the supply chain. This group have invested in over 70 biotech startups including several cultured protein producers. The specific aim of Wild Earth is to disrupt traditional petfood companies by raising awareness of ethically sourced alternatives. They intend to develop protein food products for both cats and dogs using fungi; their first dog treat is created from an Asian protein called koji and will be on the market from the end of August. Bethencourt describes the current situation with regards to pet food as “staggering” and says that as we feed millions of additional pets over the next 30 years, there will be approximately another billion dogs and cats brought into existence. The global pet food market had a value of around $94 billion last year, and is set to grow as previously impoverished countries such as China follow western trends. He says that these pets can be sustained with koji protein, and in future the plan is to create cultured meat cells from lab-grown meat using mouse cells. 2018 is certainly an interesting time for cultured meat, and if the pet food market can follow this trend it will make an impact on a global problem which is enormously unsustainable at present.

13926,ProVeg: Internationalisation and Startup Incubator,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/proveg-international-startup-incubator/,2018-07-27,"ProVeg – formerly VEBU – is an international organisation dedicated to mindfulness in the food sector. ProVeg International is currently active on four continents, and has plans for further expansion. It is setting the course for its vision of a world in which people choose delicious and healthy foods which are good for humans, animals and the environment. Matthias Rohra (COO, ProVeg) tells us more about the development of ProVeg and its future plans.  Problems such as climate change, factory farming and global hunger do not stop at national borders; they are global in nature. These global problems also need cross-border solutions. ProVeg is the first international nutrition organisation committed to the plant-based lifestyle. Such an organisation did not previously exist. ProVeg promotes the cross-border exchange of ideas and experiences and connects committed actors and interest groups worldwide, thus more effectively bringing about social change towards a sustainable way of life. Our renaming to ProVeg symbolises our completely new orientation. In Germany alone, we currently have 63 permanent employees and we continue to grow. Additionally, there are many volunteer colleagues and around 100 ProVeg regional groups, all of which work for the plant-based lifestyle throughout Germany. In addition, more than 14,000 people nationwide support the work of ProVeg through their monthly ProVeg membership.  ProVeg currently operates in the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, South Africa, Germany and the United Kingdom. Other countries, such as China and the US, are interested in becoming part of the global ProVeg movement and will soon follow suit. We are working intensively on internationalisation. ProVeg Corporate Engagement offers a very wide range of services for the food retail and catering sectors. This includes support for companies that want to produce meat-free or purely plant-based products or switch to animal-free recipes. With the V-label, which is awarded by ProVeg in Germany, manufacturers can have their products certified and thus provide even more confidence and transparency. ProVeg also trains chefs who want to bring vegetarian/vegan food to their menus, and helps them implement healthy plant-based and climate-friendly offerings. An example is the project KEEKS (Climate and Energy-Efficient Kitchen in Schools), which is supported by the Federal Environment Ministry. At trade fairs and events such as VeggieWorld, Biofach and Internorga, ProVeg acts as a competent contact in the plant-based industry for both consumers and professionals. From vegan startups to medium-sized companies such as caterers, canteens and health insurance companies to large companies that currently only sell processed meat, ProVeg advises a wide range of companies which are making it increasingly easy for consumers to choose plant-based products. In the future, ProVeg will focus even more on projects which are researching innovative plant-based alternatives. Likewise, ProVeg welcomes the development of cultivated meat. Cultured animal products have the potential to alleviate many nutrition-related global issues and dramatically minimise animal suffering. For this reason, ProVeg will engage in further research in this area – from product optimisation and production to consumer acceptance. With the Startup Incubator, ProVeg will promote product ideas which aim to permanently change the food market. We will offer startups modern office space, a large kitchen, access to our extensive network of industrial and fair trade partners, market researchers and international investors as well as a broad workshop program. The opening of the incubator is scheduled for October and we look forward to exciting applications from international founders. Young company founders, as well as those who already have exciting ideas for new foods, can now apply for the incubator program at www.proveg.com/incubator. But the ProVeg Incubator team is also looking for professional reinforcement. The job advertisements with the exact requirements can be found at www.proveg.com/jobs. In five years’ time, we want ProVeg to be represented in all the strategically most important countries worldwide. In addition to the current ProVeg countries, this also includes China, the USA and Brazil. We also want to expand our cross-sectoral networks and collaborate with decision-makers in global bodies and institutions. ProVeg will promote the development of animal-free products, especially in the business sector, and will offer manufacturers new opportunities to produce the food of the future today. We are already observing that more and more companies are switching to plant-based products and that a growing number of people are turning to plant-based alternatives for the environment and animals. The study of cultured meat is developing just as rapidly. ProVeg will actively participate in its further development.    "
13941,Mosa Meat Obtains €7.5M Funding for “Cultured Meat”,https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/mosa-meat-obtains-e7-5m-funding-for-cultured-meat/,2018-07-24,"Mosa Meats, the company who created the world’s first cultured hamburger, have just announced the procurement of €7.5M in funding from investors including M Venture and Bell Food Group, to continue in their advancement of cultured meat. The Dutch startup has led the cultured meat industry since presenting the first beef burger made directly from cow cells in 2013.  The securing of this round of investment is the first for a European Clean Meat company, and in light of recent reports concerning the environmental impact of the meat and dairy industry, this news puts Europe on the map for developments in the future of meat. The company said in their statement this week: “As the first European cultured meat company to get funded, we’re very proud but also humbled. Because the challenge before us is enormous: to keep up with growing demand for meat globally, while reducing the amount of livestock needed. Many changes are needed across several industries.” Mosa Meats are based in Maastricht in The Netherlands. Founders Mark Post and Peter Verstrate launched the company after successfully managing to prove their concept of real meat grown directly from animal cells in 2013, and are dedicated to the vision of “A more sustainable, animal-friendly way to satisfy the world’s demand for meat.” CEO of Bell Food Group, Lorenz Wyss, said of the investment: “Meat demand is soaring and in future won’t be met by livestock agriculture alone.” Whilst Alexander Hoffmann, Principal at M Ventures, stated, “Replacing traditional meat production with cultured meat would have a huge impact on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, it would free up a large amount of resources that are now used for meat production worldwide and will completely disrupt an old-established and currently unsustainable industry.”    "
13948,PHW Group: “We Have Always Taken Unconventional Paths.”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/phw-group-we-have-always-taken-unconventional-paths/,2018-07-20,"Many milk and meat producers are aware of the growth of vegan products in the market and are adapting their ranges accordingly. The PHW Group has gone one step further and established a new business area called “alternative protein sources”, which includes involvement with SuperMeat and the distribution for Beyond Meat. We asked Marcus Keitzer – the new board member for alternative protein sources – about vegan developments within the PHW Group. How are Wiesenhof’s vegan-label products developing?
The vegan products are a small but quite important part of our portfolio. We want to position ourselves more broadly in this area and are confident that we can achieve corresponding success there. Of course, meat substitutes are still a niche market and will tend to remain so. However, niche markets are still attractive. We are satisfied with the development of our veggie range and are continually working on further listings, closely monitoring the market. According to the IRI Symphony, growth in meat substitutes has increased – sales increased by 8.6% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Where do you primarily sell your vegan products?
We offer vegan products to the food industry as well as the out-of-home market. That’s why we recently presented the two high-protein products Veggie Power Burger and Veggie Power Snaps at Internorga for the out-of-home market. Since the beginning of July, you have been responsible for “alternative protein sources” on the Executive Board. What are your tasks there?
The newly created “alternative protein sources” area will bundle our existing activities in this area at board level and thus take their increasing importance into account. In the future, we will focus even more strongly on this area and will try to gradually expand it into an important business area alongside the core poultry business, both through our own product development and through strategic partnerships and targeted acquisitions. We will continue to look for promising new approaches and business ideas and work with new and innovative start-ups. Which alternative protein sources will Wiesenhof consider next? Insects, maybe?
It’s true that we are closely monitoring developments and believe that insect food has a future. We are holding some interesting discussions with various market participants, but have nothing concrete to announce at present. When will you launch your first SuperMeat products?
SuperMeat’s approach to research is quite practical. They are focused on bringing meatmix products to the market as quickly as possible and are not trying – as many others are – to make the finest chicken breast fillets. The scientists just want to create marketable products within three to five years. For which regions do you have the distribution rights for Beyond Meat products?
To begin with, the PHW Group will take over some sales and distribution in the German market. We will start marketing Beyond Burgers in the catering industry – the first burgers will be on the market in August. Further sales channels will follow later. Can we expect further news about alternative protein sources this year?
It’s incredibly exciting what’s currently happening on the worldwide market in this area. And in my new role as board member for alternative protein sources, I am constantly dealing with these questions. It is part of the DNA of the PHW Group to proceed with caution, to examine offers intensively and not to make hasty decisions. But if we are convinced and enthusiastic about a company or start-up in this area, then we will act quickly and invest as well. There is, however, nothing specific I can tell you at the moment. More and more conventional meat and dairy producers are switching wholly or partly to plant-based products. How do you assess the state of the meat market? Will meat producers have to look around for additional pillars (e.g. vegan products) in the future in order to remain competitive? As a company, we have always taken unconventional paths. Long before the organic boom, we looked at alternative approaches to animal agriculture, enabling consumers to make conscious choices in favour of specific concepts. It all started in 2000 with pasture-raised free-range chicken, followed by organic chicken in 2002. In 2011, we incorporated the wealth of experience gained here into the Privathof Poultry concept, which focuses on more animal protection and bears the label of the German Animal Protection Association. In March 2015, we launched a diverse range of vegan products to offer consumers who want a meat-free diet a good alternative to poultry meat. Since the beginning of the year, we have been going one step further and developing meat from cell cultures. Why? We believe in growth through diversity. Our task as a food manufacturer is to create as many different choices as possible; we offer the consumer a wide range of products, from conventionally produced poultry meat to privately farmed poultry and a vegan range. This is why we’ve chosen SuperMeat and a distribution partnership with Beyond Meat. Basically, we want to keep our finger on the pulse of the times and become aware of possible future market opportunities at an early stage. Poultry meat will remain our core business. However, we are broadening our product range and defining ourselves as a supplier of high-quality proteins. And as soon as in vitro alternatives become available, they will certainly play an increasing role. However, we do not believe in black and white scenarios; we believe that traditionally produced meat will still have a huge market in 30 years’ time.    "
13972,Singapore Opens Clean Meat Laboratory,https://vegconomist.com/products-and-launches/1-singapur-eroffnet-labor-fur-clean-meat/,2018-07-16,"On June 19th, a $110 million facility was opened in Singapore to produce Clean Meat. The laboratory “WIL@NUS”, created as a result of a collaboration between the agribusiness group Wilmar International Limited, the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the National Research Foundation in Singapore, is dedicated to the task of producing meat in the laboratory. The 2,000 square meter facility on the NUS campus will focus on the research and development of synthetically produced meat. The production of cultured meat on a cellular basis is expected to be cheaper and more sustainable than conventional animal rearing in the future. The new innovations are particularly intended to help the region create a healthy alternative to meat. This innovative approach to the production of Clean Meat will offer food alternatives that especially appeal to the younger generations. But with regards to the older generation, the health benefits of cultivated meat are becoming increasingly relevant. The focus here is on public health and the creation of a healthier diet. On the opening day, Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced that he was looking forward to the food from the laboratory and the healthier properties that distinguish Clean Meat. He also emphasises the possibility of more sustainable production, which has positive effects not only for people but also for the environment.    "
14001,“JUST”: Laboratory-Grown Chicken on the Market in 2018?,https://vegconomist.com/startups/just-laboratory-grown-chicken-on-the-market-in-2018/,2018-07-06,"The American start-up “JUST” from San Francisco has been offering vegan products for some time. In addition to vegan cookie dough, the company is also working on cultivated meat (Clean Meat). This year, the company wants to launch Clean Meat in the form of chicken meat. Clean Meat is usually made from animal cells, and some manufacturers use fetal bovine serum for this purpose. JUST has developed another technique to avoid this. Despite being of animal origin, Clean Meat is supported by a number of vegans as it can reduce the number of animals being slaughtered. Suppliers are aware that regulatory problems could lead to delays in the availability of clean meat products. When asked how this could be resolved, JUST founder Josh Tetrick said the first step was to realize that there is a problem, then to realize that there are tools available. “We can look for tools in the plant kingdom, and tools in the animal kingdom. In the plant kingdom, we can search many different plants. In the animal kingdom, we can take a cell from an animal without killing it, and then feed and grow it with nutrients. So there is a large toolbox in nature with which we can produce all kinds of products. And we have to do it as quickly as possible,” says Tetrick. Clean Meat from JUST will be offered in restaurants before it goes into stores. Other start-ups like Aleph Farms and BlueNalu are also trying to grow meat in the laboratory.    "
14063,Vegini: “Our Next Innovation Will Be Vegini To-Go! Products”,https://vegconomist.com/interviews/vegini-our-next-innovation-will-be-vegini-to-go-products/,2018-06-08,"In order to produce many vegan meat alternatives, ingredients such as soy, gluten or mushrooms are used. But not so with vegini. The Austrian company bases its products exclusively from peas, and wants to make the value chain shorter and more sustainable. We asked Lukas Wischenbart, responsible for Marketing & Sales at vegini, what the plans were for the German market. How is vegini currently developing in the German market?
vegini has been listed at selected food retailers since the beginning of 2017. From a sales perspective, the German market will be intensively promoted in 2018 in order to continue the success story or “proof of concept” from Austria. Currently, our vegini products are stocked by the following partners in Germany – further listings in the retail as well as in the food service industry will follow. Food retailing Online Which products are performing particularly well?
Our burger is clearly our bestseller. Consumers know what to do with it and can thus quickly and easily conjure up a meat-free alternative to classic meat dishes. Second place goes to our Pulled Chunks in various flavours, which are very versatile in wok and pan dishes for home cooking, as well as for the catering industry. What distinguishes vegini from other suppliers in this segment?
Unlike many other products on the market, our products are not made from soy, wheat gluten, mushrooms, etc. vegini is made from peas, which are adapted to the European climate. This is a huge advantage, especially when it comes to sustainability, as the water consumption for peas is considerably lower than, for example, that for soy. Our vegini products are therefore 100% sustainable. In addition, vegini is characterized by its extremely high protein content of up to 35 percent and is completely allergen-free. We do not use any additives or preservatives, so we differ from many other products in this sector. There are no artificial flavours and no E-numbers in vegini. And although they are meat alternatives, our products have a bite as good as meat, whilst being suitable for all diets. How do you intend to make your brand better known in Germany?
With vegini, our goal is to create a brand that is present throughout Europe. We have already partially achieved this on the Austrian market with numerous listings at major food retailers. Of course, a lot of effort will be required to further increase brand awareness. For the time being, we will primarily use online marketing campaigns and trade fair appearances to penetrate the German market. For the online marketing campaigns, we plan to increase our presence on social media platforms, as well as placing various banner ads. In addition, we are planning numerous tastings at the point of sale (POS for short) to make our products more appealing to customers in-store. If possible, a separate food truck team will be set up for Germany, as in Austria, to sell vegini meals at events and festivals. Which innovations can we expect from you in 2018?
Since the beginning of 2018 we have launched four new products, and we still have many others up our sleeves. New and already available in Austrian food retailers are our Schnitzerl, nuggets, sweet and sour stripes and our vegetable patties. These products will soon be distributed via a large German vegan online grocery store. Our next innovation will be vegini To-Go! Products, sold in a cup with sauce. Here you will find mini paprika patties and classic balls, which can also be eaten cold on the way to work or anywhere else. This is a completely new product in this sector, for which we have high expectations, as the to-go sector is booming. We will soon be expanding our range of convenience products with dumplings and pastries filled with vegini. Plant-based meat alternatives versus cultivated meat – do you think (in the future) that there is room for both?
In short – yes. We think that in the future the market will continue to change and vegetarian and vegan foods will play an ever greater role. At the same time, however, we are also aware that meat will nevertheless have a firm place in the nutritional needs of Europeans. We do not want to urge anyone to eat purely vegan or vegetarian food. Nevertheless, we think that meat consumption in highly developed countries should be greatly reduced. And that’s where we come in. Our target group are all those who want to eat healthy and sustainable food and who also want to relinquish meat more often without feeling that something is missing. What plans do you have for an organic product range?
At the moment vegini is not organic, because the raw materials we need are not yet regionally available. Organic pea protein and pea fibres are available from China, but that would be absolute nonsense from a sustainable point of view. The next step is to get peas directly from Austria rather than France. Since the processed raw materials that we need are not yet available here, we are in discussion with Austrian farmers. We want to implement this in the medium term over the next 3-5 years. In the long term, there are plans to switch to organic raw materials.

14126,The Fight for Meat-Free Meat Has Begun,https://vegconomist.com/politics-law/the-fight-for-meat-free-meat-has-begun/,2018-05-25,"Worldwide, the consumption of purely plant-based foods is increasing, and with it the competition between various suppliers in the food industry. As a result of this change, there are increasing complaints from the meat industry about misleading product names and distortions by suppliers of animal-free meat products. The fight for meat-free meat has begun. Plant-based alternatives to meat are a new major trend in the food industry, not least because of changing consumer habits. The number of vegan and vegetarian consumers has been increasing rapidly in recent years. Furthermore, there is growing awareness of environmental and health issues worldwide. Questions about animal welfare are even becoming a political issue. Behind this is an increasing interest in dealing with ethical and ecological problems, especially when it comes to our own health and nutrition. Ultimately, global markets are also responding to changing consumer needs. Producers are now specialising in purely plant-based products, or are expanding their existing range to include vegan alternatives. Research and development in this area is also growing significantly, and many small, innovative start-ups are enriching the market with new ideas and creations. This is also attracting many investors who for their part have recognized the growing potential and continue to spur the market on with high capital investments. With the rapid development of new plant-based meat alternatives, multi-million investments, catchy animal-free names and growing consumer interest, the worldwide struggle for the use of the word “meat” to describe plant protein products is also growing. Even in the area of “clean meat”, i.e. cultured laboratory meat, there are disputes over what the legitimate name for these products is. In the USA, there is currently a dispute about the correct definition of meat. A recent petition from the US Cattleman’s Association and the National Farmers Union, directed to the US Department of Agriculture, has demanded that the term ‘meat’ should only be used for conventional animal products. The association states: “Products not derived from animals born, raised and slaughtered in the traditional way may not be marketed as meat products.” This requirement applies to all alternative protein sources as well as to laboratory meat. In New Zealand, the company Sunfed Meats is causing a sensation with its product “Chicken Free Chicken”. The purely plant-based chicken alternative is advertised with the slogan “good for us, good for the planet, good for the animals”, and is so successful that supply cannot keep pace with demand. This finally prompted the New Zealand Poultry Industry Association to file a misleading labelling complaint with the New Zealand Commerce Commission at the end of 2017. A reply from the authority is still pending because the situation in this case is extremely complicated. The international law firm Allens is highlighting two important issues in this case – firstly, whether reasonably minded consumers could really be deceived into believing that the product is of animal origin, and secondly, whether consumers could be made to believe that meat and plant-based products have the same nutritional value. Another example is France. The French Parliament has adopted a new law which is to enter into force at the end of May and redefine the use of the term ‘meat’ with regards to product names. Under the new regulation, the French Ministry of Agriculture will be charged with establishing a list of animal-related product names which may only be used to describe animal products. Furthermore, the proportion of plant-based substances in products that can be marketed as being of animal origin will be regulated. This is part of the strategy of the meat industry, which has a strong lobby in France to protect its status. Whether and how this new legal situation will work remains to be seen. The developments here, however, could also be of interest to other countries. The dispute over misleading and legitimate product names will probably remain a thorny issue in the future and will continue to preoccupy the food industry. There are always fears of profit and loss behind these conflicts of interest. Established companies in the meat industry fear for their sales and profit figures, their market shares and not least for their good reputation. But the boundaries are not always as rigid as in the above examples. Two of the largest global meat producers – Cargill and Tyson Foods – have both invested in the American start-up Memphis Meats, which is a pioneer in meat alternatives. And many others are doing the same. Duncan Williamson, head of the Food Policy Department of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), believes that concerns about the use of meat-like terms for plant-based products are an overreaction. “By raising this issue, opponents are creating a false problem. I haven’t seen a single sign of customers being misled. Most of the evidence I’ve seen shows that people know exactly whether it’s meat. People know that an “Impossible Burger” is not meat. People know that a Linda McCartney sausage is not meat sausage, but textured soy. People aren’t stupid. There’s a place for everything, and I think the meat industry is worrying unnecessarily.” Williamson also stresses the importance of the major environmental problems facing humanity. Examples include climate change and the loss of biodiversity, but also problems such as antibiotic resistance and health problems caused by excessive meat consumption. “It is absolutely crucial that we rebalance the food system, and a reduction in meat consumption is a necessary part of it. We have to do it,” he adds. The fight for meat-free meat is certainly still in its infancy, though the waves it is making are already very high. It remains to be seen how it will all pan out.    "
14184,Tyson Invests $2.2 Million in In-Vitro Meat Start-Up,https://vegconomist.com/companies-and-portraits/tyson-invests-vitro-meat/,2018-05-04,"Global food giant Tyson is investing $2.2 million in the Israeli clean-meat startup Future Meat Technologies.  “Future Meat Technologies”, from Jerusalem, produces meat synthetically from animal cells. It’s currently working on making in-vitro meat (also called cultured meat or clean meat) affordable to the average consumer. According to the company, the “Clean Meat” currently costs around $800 per kilo, but should be available for between $5 and $10 by 2020.   Although this type of laboratory meat is not directly vegan, it is supported by a large number of vegans, as it could significantly reduce the total number of animals slaughtered and is reportedly more environmentally-friendly than livestock.   The investment represents a big step forward for Tyson in the field of cultured meat. The company has already invested in the startup “Beyond Meat”.   Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Chief Sustainability Officer of Tyson Foods, Justin Whitmore, says: “This is our first investment in an Israeli company. We look forward to this opportunity to broaden our horizons with new, innovative ways of producing alternative meat.”   Prof. Yaakov Nahmias, the founder and senior scientist of the company, added: “I want my children to eat meat that is delicious, sustainable and unharmful. That’s our commitment to future generations. “    "
14220,NESTLÉ IS FIRST MAJOR FOOD COMPANY TO GET BEHIND LAB-GROWN MEAT. IS THAT A GOOD THING?,https://vegnews.com/2021/7/nestle-lab-grown-meat,2021-07-14,"Nestlé might be the first major food company to add lab-grown meat to its portfolio of products. According to Bloomberg, the Swiss food giant is in talks with Israel-based cultured meat startup Future Meat Technologies (FMT) to “explore the potential of cultured-meat components that do not compromise on taste or sustainability.” FMT grows real animal meat in a lab-setting from a small amount of animal cells, negating the need to raise and slaughter animals for food. Potentially, Nestlé will incorporate FMT’s novel meat products into its Garden Gourmet brand to offer consumers a product that blends cultured and plant-based meat. While Nestlé has engaged in a number of problematic business practices throughout its more than 150 years in operation, the company is betting on both plant-based and lab-grown meat as the future of food. Under its Garden Gourmet brand in Europe, Nestlé offers a variety of plant-based products in the retail and foodservice sector, including the Incredible Burger patty (now “Sensational Burger”) which was featured as part of The Big Vegan TS burger at McDonald’s in Germany. Stateside, the Swiss giant owns vegetarian brand Sweet Earth, under which it offers vegan meats such as the Awesome Burger and Awesome Grounds. Nestlé has also modernized some of its classic brands to include Sweet Earth’s vegan meat products such as DiGiorno pizzas and Stouffer’s lasagna.  Bruce Friedrich, founder and president of food advocacy group Good Food Institute (GFI), says Nestlé’s interest in bringing cultured meat to the masses is a big step in the right direction. “Nestlé’s involvement at this level could be transformative for the cultivated meat industry and should significantly advance what needs to be a global norm: delivering more sustainable proteins to consumers around the world. When Nestlé talks, the worldwide food industry listens,” Friedrich said. “For Nestlé to see the potential of cultivating real animal meat directly from cells would be a game changer for the industry.” One of the biggest hurdles in getting cultured meat to market are high production costs. In 2013, Mark Post—founder of biotechnology company Mosa Meat—unveiled the world’s first lab-grown burger, which cost $325,000 to produce, a cost that startups, including FMT, have since cut drastically by scaling production and developing less costly growth mediums and other inputs.  Earlier this year, FMT revealed that it brought the cost of production of its cultured chicken down to just $7.50 per quarter-pound serving, a 1,000-fold reduction in production costs of cultured meat. In June, FMT—which counts meat giant Tyson as an early investor—opened its production facility in Rehovot, Israel which is capable of producing 500 kilograms (1,110 pounds) of cultured products per day, the equivalent of 5,000 hamburgers. FMT’s cruelty-free production process is expected to generate 80-percent less greenhouse gas emissions while using 99-percent less land and 96-percent less freshwater than traditional meat production.  In addition to high production costs, another hurdle in getting the novel technology to consumers is government regulatory approval. FMT is seeking regulatory approval in several territories and aims to begin marketing its products—which, in addition to cultured chicken, also include slaughter-free lamb kebabs and cell-based beef burgers—to consumers and restaurants in the US in 2022.  Late last year, Singapore granted regulatory approval to cultured chicken made by California-based startup Eat Just—known best for its vegan JUST Egg—under its GOOD Meat brand. Soon thereafter, upscale eatery 1880 became the first restaurant in the world to offer cultured meat on its menu. The Singaporean restaurant showcased Eat Just’s cultured chicken in a variety of dishes made to initiate conversation about the past, present, and future of food. The restaurant also partnered with delivery platform FoodPanda, which now offers local delivery of cultured chicken—another world first.   And while other players in the cultured meat industry have held tasting events for investors and the public to demonstrate their cell-based concepts, currently, the only place in the world where cultured meat can be sold is Singapore. However, that might soon change and companies worldwide—which make cell-based versions of everything from beef patties to shellfish—are betting on a new era of meat production being right around the corner.  In the US, aquaculture startup Wildtype announced last month that it intends to open a first-of-its-kind cell-based sushi restaurant adjacent to its cultured seafood pilot plant in San Francisco. Currently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is moving through a pre-market consultation process and pending regulatory approval, the restaurant would serve sushi grade salmon and other fish it makes from a few cells, bypassing the need to raise fish for slaughter or destroy the oceans trying to catch them. Wildtype’s pilot plant recently became operational with a near-term capacity of producing approximately 50,000 pounds of seafood in this way per year. At maximum capacity, the plant will be able to produce upwards of 200,000 pounds of slaughter-free seafood annually.  GFI encourages world governments to rapidly follow in Singapore’s footsteps to support the global effort of fighting the climate crisis. “We need both the public and private sector to go all-in on making meat from plants and cultivating meat from cells,” Friedrich said. “Governments must invest in these innovations now to slash the climate impact of our food system and stand a chance of moving the world to net-zero emissions by 2050.” "
14250,THE WORLD’S FIRST LAB-GROWN SUSHI BAR IS ABOUT TO OPEN IN SAN FRANCISCO,https://vegnews.com/2021/6/lab-grown-sushi-bar-san-francisco,2021-06-30,"This fall, a first-of-its-kind sushi bar is slated to open in San Francisco, CA where all the fish on the menu has never been pulled from the ocean, or been alive, for that matter. That’s because the sushi bar is operated by Wildtype, an aquaculture startup that grows sushi-grade salmon from a small amount of fish cells in a lab-setting. Adjacent to its pilot production facility, the sushi bar will be part of a complex operated by Wildtype and designed by acclaimed architect Shuo Zhai which features an education center with bleacher seating and a glass door separating the tasting room from the production floor—elements that promote transparency in the novel cultivated meat industry, and a stark contrast to the opacity of the global industrial fishing industry.    Founded by cardiologist Aryé Elfenbein and former diplomat Justin Kolbeck, the company aims to reduce the stress caused by industrial fishing on the oceans by offering a cell-based fish alternative that is identical to its animal-based counterpart in all the ways that matter.  “Global demand for seafood is outpacing supply, so the status quo needs to change. Our pilot plant will showcase the promise and wonder of growing fish fillets using cell cultivation,” Elfenbein said. “In addition to being designed to shorten innovation cycles and facilitate the scaling of food production, the facility will be a place where the public can learn about this fascinating new technology.” Wildtype’s pilot plant recently became operational with a near-term capacity of producing approximately 50,000 pounds of seafood per year. At maximum capacity, the plant will be able to produce upwards of 200,000 pounds of slaughter-free seafood annually. Bringing that cell-based fish to market is complicated by the fact that the United States has yet to grant regulatory approval for meat made in this way. However, that may soon change as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is now moving through a pre-market consultation process.   Currently, Singapore is the only country in the world to allow the sale of cell-based meat. After a lengthy and thorough process, Singapore granted regulatory approval for the sale of Eat Just’s cell-based chicken bites late last year. Shortly thereafter, the California-based startup partnered with experiential restaurant 1880 to showcase its GOOD Meat Cultured Chicken on the menu in a variety of dishes made to spark a conversation about the past, present, and future of the global food system.  While 1880’s tasting was the first time that cell-based meat was sold anywhere in the world, it wasn’t the first time that it was sampled by the public. Last year, Israel-based food technology startup SuperMeat unveiled the world’s first lab-grown meat restaurant called “The Chicken,” a test kitchen that sits adjacent to its pilot production plant—similar to what Wildtype plans to do with its sushi bar. There, SuperMeat served guests samples of its lab-grown chicken in two burger options, along with other dishes to highlight the star ingredient.   In the seafood realm, San Diego-based BluNalu held a tasting of its yellowtail amberjack in 2019 for investors and global partners where its chefs prepared the lab-grown fish in traditional ways (raw, acidified, and cooked) to show its versatility. In addition to yellowtail, BlueNalu has successfully created other finfish products, including mahi mahi and red snapper, and aims to launch them this year, pending regulatory approval.   In Singapore, local aquaculture startup Shiok Meats is developing cell-based shrimp, lobster, and crab to tackle the cruel crustacean industry in the Asia-Pacific region where slave labor continues to be a human-rights issue. Last year, the startup raised $12.6 million to fund its mission and aims to launch its first commercial product, diced shrimp, in 2022.  While the plight of our oceans has been discussed for decades, documentary film Seaspiracy—made by Kip Andersen, the filmmaker behind Cowspiracy and What the Health?—brought the horror of the global industrial fishing industry back into the spotlight when it premiered on Netflix in March. The need to develop novel solutions to save the oceans has never been greater and both cell-based companies and plant-based seafood producers are stepping up to the challenge.  In April, vegan seafood brand Good Catch secured a $26 million funding round through its parent company Gathered Foods in order to ramp up innovation, increase its product lines, and expand its brand internationally. Known for its vegan tuna, Good Catch makes plant-based seafood from a proprietary blend of six beans and legumes. Last year, the brand entered a joint venture agreement with Bumble Bee Foods, through which it will leverage the tuna giant’s sales, distribution, and logistics expertise to make Gathered Foods’ vegan products accessible to a wide range of customers at affordable prices. Globally, a growing number of companies are getting into the plant-based seafood business, including Hong Kong-based vegan brand OmniFoods. Founded by eco-conscious entrepreneur David Yeung—who owns social enterprise Green Monday—OmniFoods is already known in Asia for its plant-based pork alternatives. Launched last month, its new OmniSeafood line features vegan fish products such as Omni Classic Fillet, Omni Golden Fillet, and Omni Ocean Burger—in original, battered, or breaded fish burger varieties—along with OmniTuna and a soon-to-be-launched OmniSalmon.

14256,"3,000 HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS ADD VEGAN BURGERS TO MENUS",https://vegnews.com/2021/6/3000-hospitals-and-schools-add-vegan-burgers-to-menus,2021-06-28,"Food brand MorningStar Farms—a subsidiary of The Kellogg Company—will expand its “Incogmeato” vegan meat line to more than 3,000 hospitals and schools. Kellogg’s is expanding its partnership with foodservice company Sodexo to meet the increasing demand for plant-based protein options. Sodexo already serves MorningStar Farms’ Spicy Black Bean Burgers and has just added the Incogmeato Burger Patties to its offerings, beginning with the healthcare sector.  “We’re excited to expand our partnership with Kellogg’s Away From Home [its food service arm] to offer our meat-loving customers a plant-based protein … to [allow them to] make more sustainable and plant-based choices without sacrificing what they love about meat,” Rob Morasco, Senior Director of Culinary Development at Sodexo, said. “More people are exploring plant-based food options and we’ve seen a growing demand in our industry … Plant-based meat alternatives also support Sodexo’s carbon reduction goal to reduce operational and supply chain carbon emissions by 34 percent by 2025, a commitment of our Better Tomorrow 2025 plan.”  MorningStar’s Incogmeato line of vegan meat products debuted at grocery stores and through foodservice partners in early 2020. The products aim to replicate the look and taste of animal-based meats and include vegan burger patties, Chick’n Tenders, and Chick’n Nuggets.  Prior to adding Incogmeato vegan sausage to its lineup, in 2019 the brand partnered with Pizza Hut to test the new vegan Italian sausage at one location in Phoenix, AZ. The limited-time test featured the plant-based sausage atop the Garden Specialty Pizza, which also included onions, mushrooms, and banana peppers and could be ordered vegan by omitting cheese. While this test did not ultimately result in a nationwide offering of the Incogmeato vegan sausage at the restaurant, Pizza Hut did continue its vegan meat offerings and became the first chain in its category to launch vegan meat nationwide with its two Beyond Pan Pizzas in partnership with Beyond Meat.  Incogmeato’s expansion to schools means it can focus on getting its brand in front of the Gen Z audience. Kellogg’s own research found that the type of “just-like-meat” experience offered by Incogmeato is the preferred choice for 40 percent of the Gen Z-ers and millennials the company surveyed—while the remaining 60 percent of those surveyed prefer plant-based proteins like the MorningStar Farms’ Spicy Black Bean Burger. The Gen Z group is also helping to push the vegan movement forward. Reports have suggested that they are more likely to switch to alternative proteins to help save the environment than older generations.  “Our Incogmeato lineup is a delicious plant-based solution for Sodexo’s guests who are craving a truly meat-like experience,” Zach Ramos, General Manager, Kellogg’s Away From Home, said. “We are proud to offer our operator partners go-to plant-based options that give their guests what they’re craving—especially as consumer demand for just-like-meat products continues to grow.” "
14289,CARGILL CEO: “THE PLANT-BASED PROTEIN INDUSTRY WILL EAT INTO CONSUMER DEMAND FOR MEAT”,https://vegnews.com/2021/6/cargill-ceo-plant-based-protein-industry,2021-06-10,"The plant-based protein industry will eat into consumer demand for meat as the rapidly growing sector expands, Cargill CEO David MacLennan recently stated. “Our analysis is that in … three to four years plant-based will be perhaps 10 percent of the market. We’re a large beef producer and that is a big part of our portfolio. So there’s some cannibalization that will occur,” MacLennan said at a National Grain and Feed Association convention. Meat giant Cargill—one of the biggest meat producers in the world—has already made its own investments in the plant-based protein sector in Asia and North America and has stated that its vegan meat products will challenge brands such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods for sales in grocery stores, cafeterias, and restaurants. Cargill is also dipping into the plant-based ingredient sector by creating food ingredients as a supplier for other brands. In a partnership with PURIS Foods, Cargill has become the largest North American producer of pea protein, supplying the ingredient to brands such as Beyond Meat. Last year, Cargill also launched its first plant-based protein brand PlantEver in China, which includes vegan chicken nuggets and burger patties. The move came after the company saw a successful trial of its plant-based nuggets at three locations of fast-food chain KFC in China—which sold out within one hour of its launch. Last year the meat giant also launched a line of plant-based products, co-branded with Japanese chain Lawson, featuring products such as vegan scallops and chicken tenders.   Other large meat producers such as Tyson are joining the plant-based meat sector with their own offerings. Earlier this year, Tyson Foods launched its first fully plant-based burgers, sausages, and grounds at retailers nationwide under its Raised & Rooted line. Though its Raised & Rooted line was originally created to capitalize on the growing plant-based meat trend by blending plant-based meat with animal ingredients such as egg whites and beef, the use of animal ingredients presented a problem because they were marketed as “plant-based.” Last year, Tyson committed to removing animal products from its Raised & Rooted brand and discontinued The Blend burger patties in favor of launching its new fully vegan plant-based burgers.  “One recent and notable change we are making is to the formula for Raised & Rooted Nugget to eliminate egg whites,” David Ervin, Vice President of Alternative Protein at Tyson, said. “Moving forward, Raised & Rooted products will not contain any animal products.” The new fully plant-based nuggets are available in retailers such as Walmart, Kroger, Target, Safeway, and Costco this month.

14297,DANISH RESEARCHERS RAISE $9 MILLION TO DEVELOP A NEW VEGAN PROTEIN THAT’S BETTER FOR THE PLANET ,https://vegnews.com/2021/6/danish-researchers-develop-vegan-protein,2021-06-09,"Danish researchers in the Department of Food Science at the University of Copenhagen have received DKK 56 million (US $9 million) to develop the fundamental knowledge required to invent a completely new category of vegan protein as a sustainable alternative to animal protein. The grant comes from the Novo Nordisk Foundation’s “Proteins for Tomorrow’s Food” program and is one of the largest investments in Denmark for research in food proteins.  The research, carried out in a partnership between the University of Copenhagen, the Technical University of Denmark and Utrecht University in the Netherlands, processes yellow peas and oats—both crops of which are currently being used primarily for animal feed—using a fermentation method and a combination of Bacillus bacteria and various molds, resulting in improved digestibility, more flavor, and a increased essential amino acid profile. The research suggests that the methods should be transferable to other plant crops, with the oats representing grains and the yellow peas representing legumes.  “In Proferment, we will use fermentation to optimize plant-based protein sources, so that the nutrient content and nutrient availability is increased, while creating flavours and textures that are appealing to us humans and provide a good eating experience,” Lead researcher and University of Copenhagen Professor Dennis Sandris Nielsen said.  According to the researchers, when it comes to processing plants into protein-rich foods, we are roughly where we were in terms of development as dairy processing was at the beginning of Industrialization. At that point, we knew very little about what was going on at the microbiological and biochemical levels, leading to fluctuations in quality. “With the climate changes we are facing, we just have to figure it out much faster than we did with dairy products,” Nielsen said.  And that’s the point of the project: to create new plant-based protein that is much more climate-friendly but also healthy. Currently, one third of the Earth’s arable land is used to grow feed for animals. Theoretically, this land could be used to feed four billion more people.  “Many consumers prioritize the environment, but at the moment they have to settle for highly processed meat alternatives. We lack methods for making plant-based alternatives to meat that are treated more naturally and can be described as ‘clean label.’ Therefore, we want to make use of fermentation,” Nielsen said. The aim is to create a holistic concept using fermentation to address the challenges that exist when using plants as raw materials as a real alternative to animal protein. The research will run from 2022 through 2027.  In its 2020 State of the Industry Report, food advocacy group The Good Food Institute named “fermentation” as a third pillar of alternative proteins, next to plant-based and cell-based. According to the report, 51 fermentation companies are focused exclusively or predominantly on developing alternative proteins using this method. Last year, Chicago-based startup Nature’s Fynd (formerly Sustainable Bioproducts) raised $45 million in venture debt and equipment financing to bring its innovative vegan products—made with the help of volcanic microbes found in Yellowstone National Park—to market. As part of its process, the company isolates the microorganisms, feeds them glycerin and starches, and ferments them in a laboratory setting to create “Fy,” an animal-free complete protein that contains all nine amino acids and is high in fiber and vitamins.  Last summer, California-based startup Perfect Day—which uses microbial fermentation to create dairy-identical products—closed a $300 million Series C round. Over in Belgium, Jaap Korteweg and Niko Koffeman—who sold their meat brand The Vegetarian Butcher to multinational conglomerate Unilever in 2018—launched startup Those Vegan Cowboys with the mission of creating next-level vegan cheese through microbial fermentation.

14342,EAT JUST RAISED RECORD $170 MILLION TO REPLACE CHICKEN WITH LAB-GROWN MEAT IN OUR LIFETIME,https://vegnews.com/2021/5/eat-just-170-million-raised,2021-05-20,"This week, California-based startup Eat Just raised a record $170 million for its GOOD Meat division to support the proliferation of cell-based meat. Eat Just will use the new funding—the largest capital raise in the cellular industry to date—to increase production and accelerate research and development of its cultured meat (grown from a small number of animal cells in a lab setting). The technology makes it possible to grow meat in a way that eliminates animal cruelty while greatly diminishing the environmental inputs, such as land and water, necessary in conventional animal agriculture.  “This deal is changing the future in terms of how humanity is fed. Eat Just has led and dominated the plant-based egg category with its JUST Egg products, and with all the efforts made, we’re confident that GOOD Meat will lead the cultured meat category starting with the $193 billion chicken market,” said Nabil Borhanu, founder and Managing Partner of Graphene Ventures, an investor in the round. “For us, this is not only about meat, it’s about fueling the growth of planet-friendly food alternatives that can feed a rapidly changing world.” Last year, Singapore became the first nation in the world to grant regulatory approval for Eat Just’s cultured chicken. Soon after, experiential restaurant 1880 was the first in the world to sell dishes made with its slaughter-free chicken which it first served to young diners between the ages of 14 and 18—an age group Eat Just says has shown the biggest concern for creating a better planet. In April, Eat Just partnered with delivery platform Foodpanda to make lab-grown chicken dishes from 1880 available for home delivery in Singapore—another world first.  This month, hotel JW Marriott Singapore South Beach made a commitment to replace conventional chicken with GOOD Meat cell-based chicken at its renowned Cantonese restaurant Madame Fan during set times. The new dishes include Asian-inspired chicken salad with sesame mirin vinaigrette, steamed chicken dumplings, and chicken vegetable stir-fry. Starting May 20, GOOD Meat will replace conventional chicken for delivery on Thursdays and once every week for dine-in starting soon.  “This investment, along with the historic decision by JW Marriott Singapore South Beach, points to what’s ahead: meat without killing animals will replace conventional meat at some point in our lifetimes,” Josh Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of Eat Just, said. “The faster we make that happen, the healthier our planet will be.”  The GOOD Meat investment comes on the heels of Eat Just’s separate $200 million capital raise earlier this year. That funding will go toward growing Eat Just in a number of ways, including its core business around vegan JUST Egg. Since its retail launch in 2019, the mung bean-based vegan egg replacer has sold the vegan equivalent of 100 million eggs.  Outside of the retail sector, JUST Egg is gaining momentum on menus worldwide, including at fast-food chain Dicos in China which replaced chicken eggs with JUST Egg across several menu items in January. In Canada, fast-casual chain Copper Brand just added the vegan egg as part of four sandwiches on its breakfast menu. Stateside, the vegan egg was just added to the menu of coffee chains Peet’s Coffee and Philz, which both serve it in fully vegan breakfast sandwiches made with JUST Egg, plant-based meat, and non-dairy cheese.  Currently, Eat Just is building a state-of-the-art protein production facility in Singapore in partnership with Proterra Asia, the top food-focused investment fund in Asia. The partners will operate as Eat Just Asia and the facility will be the largest plant protein factory in Singapore serving JUST Egg manufacturing and distribution partners across Asia. "
14345,"89 PERCENT OF GEN Z IN US AND UK WOULD TRY LAB-GROWN MEAT, STUDY FINDS",https://vegnews.com/2021/5/gen-z-lab-grown-meat,2021-05-19,"Eighty-seven to 89 percent of Gen Z adults in the United States and United Kingdom are at least somewhat open to trying lab-grown meat, according to a new study published in the scientific journal Foods. Lab-grown meat—also known as cultured, cultivated, or cell-based meat—is made using a small amount of animal cells grown in a lab setting, eliminating the need to slaughter animals. Commissioned by cellular agriculture company Aleph Foods, the research also showed that 84 to 85 percent of Millennials, 76 to 77 percent of Gen X, and 70 to 74 percent of Boomers are also open to trying slaughter-free meat.  Researchers of the study surveyed a representative sample of 2,018 US and 2,034 UK consumers, the majority of whom were not familiar with lab-grown meat, yet upon being presented with a description of the innovation, the respondents said that lab-grown meat could make up about 40 percent of their future meat intake.  The survey segmented the participants by age and by degree of enthusiasm and found that 40 percent of consumers were “very” or “extremely likely” to try lab-grown meat in both the US and the UK—a group researchers categorized as the “early majority” group. Of this group, an overwhelming 98-99 percent of respondents said they would consider welcoming lab-grown meat as a regular item in their shopping baskets. Nearly all of the early majority group are omnivores (approximately 95 percent) who consume meat two to three times per day in a typical week. “The results suggest that cultivated meat is likely to be widely accepted by the general public, especially the younger generations and an eager group of early adopters who appreciate its benefits across a wide range of social issues. These groups tend to embrace change and need little encouragement to try new food innovations,” lead research scientist Keri Szejda, PhD, said. “Additionally, we observed an increase in support for the technology once consumers had access to additional information, underscoring the importance of effective science communication for consumer adoption.”  A number of startups around the world are working to develop lab-grown versions of every animal product, from beef to chicken to lobster, in an effort to disrupt the environmentally destructive and cruel animal agriculture industry. Aleph Farms debuted its first cultivated steak in 2018. One year later, the company grew the steak on the International Space Station outside of the Earth’s orbit to show that the technology can create food sources with very limited natural resources such as land and water (which it will be doing for the second time this year). Currently, the company is transferring its first commercial product to its first BioFarm, a pilot production plant with a launch planned for 2022 and will bring its slaughter-free meat to Brazil with the help of BRF, S.A.—one of the largest meat suppliers in the world. One of the biggest hurdles in bringing lab-grown meat to market has been obtaining regulatory approval. Last year, Singapore granted regulatory approval of GOOD Meat chicken—made by California-based startup Eat Just—becoming the first country in the world to authorize the sale of lab-grown meat. Shortly thereafter, avant-garde restaurant 1880 added the chicken to its menu, becoming the first eatery in the world to sell cultured meat. GOOD Meat has since partnered with delivery platform Foodpanda to make meals such as Katsu Chicken Curry, Chicken & Rice, and Chicken Caesar Salad made with its cell-based chicken available for delivery in Singapore.

14387,MEAT GIANT TYSON JUST LAUNCHED ITS FIRST PLANT-BASED BURGER,https://vegnews.com/2021/5/tyson-first-plant-based-burger,2021-05-04,"This week, Tyson Foods—the largest meat producer in the United States—launched its first fully plant-based burgers, sausages, and grounds at retailers nationwide. Under its Raised & Rooted line, the company now offers soy-free plant-based burgers, Italian and Bratwurst sausage flavors, and vegan meat grounds made from pea protein. The new products are competitively priced with animal-derived meat (from $4.99 to $7.99 per package) and can be found in the refrigerated section in grocery stores.  “Our plant-based proteins deliver the same delicious flavors, in a better-for-you alternative, they are plants made meatier,” David Ervin, Vice President of Marketing at Raised & Rooted, said. “We are excited to provide people with satisfying alternative protein options perfect for any occasion.”  Through its venture capital arm, Tyson Ventures, the meat giant previously held a 6.5 percent stake in Beyond Meat and sold it in April 2019, a month before the vegan brand’s record-breaking IPO, to pursue its own plant-based alternatives. In June 2019, Tyson launched its first products under the Raised & Rooted brand: Nuggets Made with Plants (meatless chicken nuggets that contained egg whites) and The Blend burger patties made mostly with beef and pea protein isolate—a key ingredient in many plant-based meat products. While the brand aimed to capitalize on the growing plant-based meat trend, using animal-derived ingredients presented a problem. Last year, Tyson committed to removing animal products from its Raised & Rooted brand and discontinued The Blend burger patties in favor of launching its new fully vegan plant-based burgers. Raised & Rooted products—which also include Spicy Nuggets and Whole Grain Tenders—are now distributed at 10,000 retailers across the US and Europe.  “We are excited about the momentum we’ve built over the past year, fueled by our growth at retail, and our ability to continue to meet consumer’s demands,” Ervin said. “Raised & Rooted was created to provide plant-based options for everyone, and our new products are the next step toward meeting that goal while remaining steadfast to our commitment to providing great tasting alternative options.” "
14418,LAB-GROWN MEAT IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR DELIVERY FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER,https://vegnews.com/2021/4/lab-grown-meat-available-for-delivery,2021-04-22,"Today, cell-based (also known as “lab-grown” and “cultured”) meat became available for home delivery for the first time in history thanks to a partnership between California-based startup Eat Just and delivery platform Foodpanda. Customers can now order three dishes made with GOOD Meat chicken (a brand under which Eat Just is innovating its cell-based meats) from Singapore-based restaurant 1880: Chicken & Rice with coconut rice, pak choi, sweet chili, chrysanthemums, and microgreens; Katsu Chicken Curry with jasmine rice, heritage carrots, micro shiso, and edible flowers; and Chicken Caesar Salad with kale, romaine, edible flowers, shaved radish, and plant-based Caesar dressing.  To further promote the eco-friendly nature of growing meat from cells rather than slaughtering animals for meat en masse, each order—delivered by electric bicycles in 1880’s delivery zone—will come packed in sustainable packaging made with bamboo fiber and resin. Each order will also include a Google Cardboard headset that plays a film about GOOD Meat’s connection to the importance of preserving the planet.  “Food is at the core of our business, and ensuring that we have a sustainable food ecosystem is an important agenda for us. Foodpanda is thrilled to be the first platform in the world to deliver cultured meat dishes so that customers in Singapore can be the world’s first diners to enjoy them from the comforts of their home,” Jakob Angele, CEO of Foodpanda APAC, said. “Together with Eat Just, we hope to bring this to more markets—not just in Asia but also in every country in the world where Delivery Hero [its parent company and an Eat Just investor] brands operate.”  Last year, Singapore granted regulatory approval of GOOD Meat chicken (which is grown from a small amount of animal cells in a lab setting)—becoming the first country in the world to authorize the sale of lab-grown meat. Shortly thereafter, avant-garde restaurant 1880 added the chicken to its menu, becoming the first eatery in the world to sell cultured meat. Thus far, hundreds of diners at 1880 have tasted GOOD Meat chicken and the approval ratings are high, with 70 percent of diners stating that it is as good, or better, than conventional chicken and 90 percent of diners indicating that they would substitute traditionally raised chicken with cultured meat. To expand the reach of its innovative meat, in the coming months, Eat Just and Foodpanda will continue their partnership to offer customers new dishes made with Good Meat, including in mid-May when cultured meat dishes from JW Marriott Singapore South Beach will be available for home delivery on the app. “Bringing GOOD Meat directly to the homes of people in Singapore with Foodpanda is another historically important step in our journey to build a safer, healthier food system,” Eat JUST CEO and Co-founder Josh Tetrick said.  In addition to Eat Just, a growing number of startups around the world are working to develop cell-based versions of every animal product, from beef to pork to lobster, all in an effort to disrupt the environmentally destructive animal agriculture industry. Some of the hurdles toward commercialization of these innovations are bringing production costs down and gaining regulatory approval, factors that Eat Just has shown are not impossible to achieve through its operations in Singapore.

14490,VEGAN SHORT RIBS JUST LAUNCHED AT SUPERMARKETS IN JAPAN,https://vegnews.com/2021/3/vegan-short-ribs-just-launched-at-133-japanese-supermarkets,2021-03-30,"On March 29, Tokyo-based vegan brand Next Meats will launch its plant-based barbecue meat products at select locations of Japanese superstore Ito Yokado. Customers will be able to find Next Meats’ vegan kalbi (barbecue short ribs) and harami (skirt steak) in the meat department alongside animal-derived versions of these products, which the company says signals a paradigm shift in Japan.  “Plant-based meats are becoming increasingly popular and available around the world and Japan, but most products were typically displayed in the soy products, dried foods, or preserved food sections, which undoubtedly contributed to consumers’ lack of interest and association that it is a viable protein substitute,” Next Meats said in a statement. “However with a superstore chain like Ito Yokado displaying Next Meats’ plant-based meats alongside animal meat, alternative proteins may finally be recognized as an equally sufficient source of protein as regular meat.” Founded in 2020, Next Meats aims to raise awareness around the damaging effects of animal agriculture in Japan and offer alternatives to popular meat cuts. The brand’s kalbi and harami can also be found on the menu at Yakiniku Like, a Japanese barbecue restaurant with locations across Japan. In recent years, a number of startups similar to Next Meats have emerged to introduce vegan options in Japan—a country where fully plant-based meals are often hard to find. One such startup is DAIZ, which raised a 650 million yen ($6 million) investment last May with the purpose of building Japan’s largest plant-based meat factory with the goal of producing 3,000 tons of vegan meat annually.  From 2018 to 2020, the number of vegan restaurants in Japan increased from 400 to 1,000 and plant-based options are growing at both large and small restaurants across the country. Last year alone, Japan’s most popular fast-food chain Mos Burger added the vegan Green Burger to its locations in Tokyo and Kanagawa; IKEA Japan added a variety of plant-based meal options, including a vegan version of katsu curry made with a soy cutlet instead of traditional pork or chicken; and Burger King added the Plant-Based Whopper—featuring a soy-based patty by Australian vegan brand v2food—to select locations across Japan for a limited time.

14525,VEGAN AND ALTERNATIVE PROTEIN COMPANIES RAISE RECORD $3.1 BILLION IN 2020,https://vegnews.com/2021/3/vegan-and-alternative-protein-companies-raise-record-31-billion-in-2020,2021-03-19,"The alternative protein industry raised a record $3.1 billion in investment capital in 2020—which is three times as much as it raised in 2019—according to new data released by nonprofit The Good Food Institute (GFI). The data includes major players in the plant-based protein sector making animal-free alternatives to meat, cheese, and eggs (which raised $2.1 billion in investments in 2020, three times the amount raised in 2019); the cultivated meat sector using a small amount of animal cells to grow meat without the need to slaughter animals (which received $360 million in investments, representing six times the amount the industry raised in 2019); and the fermentation industry using microbial fermentation to create animal-free alternatives to animal protein (which amounted to $590 million in investments, double what the sector raised in 2019).  According to GFI, the record capital raise signals investor confidence in alternatives to animal products amid the various challenges presented during 2020, including growing awareness of the climate crisis and its link to animal agriculture, health issues tied to zoonotic diseases, and economic factors brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. “The investor community is waking up to the massive social and economic potential of food technology to radically remake our food system,” GFI Senior Investor Engagement Specialist Sharyn Murray said. “Early trend setters like Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat, Memphis Meats, and Mosa Meat continue to perform well, and there are more and more entrepreneurs who see the potential of alternative proteins to succeed in the marketplace while having a positive global impact on food sustainability and global health.” In the past decade, plant-based protein companies have raised $4.4 billion, with nearly half ($2.1 billion) raised last year alone. In 2020, the largest capital raise in this sector went to Impossible Foods, which pulled in $700 million in two funding rounds. In the cultivated meat industry, Memphis Meat clocked in the biggest investment with $186 million, while the fermentation industry’s biggest player was Perfect Day, which raised $300 million in July to advance its mission of replacing dairy with “microflora” created outside of the cow.   “2020 was a breakout year for alternative proteins, with record investment flowing into all segments of the industry. This is yet another signal of the significant potential the private sector sees in this rapidly growing global industry,” GFI Director of Corporate Engagement Caroline Bushnell said. “While the amount is record-breaking, more investment is needed—from both the public and the private sectors—to meet the urgency of this moment. A large-scale shift toward alternative proteins will be critical to mitigating the environmental impact of food production, meeting the Paris Climate Agreement, and sustainably feeding a growing global population.” Photo Credit: Impossible Foods "
14561,MEAT GIANT TO BRING LAB-GROWN MEAT TO BRAZIL ,https://vegnews.com/2021/3/meat-giant-to-bring-lab-grown-meat-to-brazil,2021-03-05,"This week, food company BRF, S.A.—one of the largest meat suppliers in the world—signed a deal with Israel-based cultured meat company Aleph Farms to bring its innovative lab-grown meat to Brazil. Under the Memorandum of Understanding agreement, BRF will co-develop and produce lab-grown meat in one of Aleph Farms’ BioFarm platforms. While traditional animal agriculture requires many inputs and produces large amounts of greenhouse gases, Aleph Farms’ approach relies on a few animal cells that are grown in a bioreactor to create meat without the need to slaughter animals and with a much smaller environmental footprint.  “BRF is ready and charged to play a leading role in this food revolution and be an active participant in one of the greatest industry transformations of this generation,” BRF CEO Lorival Luz said. “Since 2014, we have witnessed an increasing global demand for new sources of protein driven by several factors, namely environmental concerns, new diets and lifestyles, which has spurred the growth of new dietary genres including flexitarianism, vegetarianism, and more.” Aleph Farms debuted its first cultivated steak in 2018 and has since increased its size and adapted it to be viable for large-scale production. In 2019, Aleph Farms grew its cell-based steak on the International Space Station outside of the Earth’s orbit to show that the technology can create food sources with very limited natural resources such as land and water. Last month, the company unveiled a 3D-printed cultivated ribeye steak that builds upon Aleph Farms’ initial cell-based steak to provide the same sensory experience of a thicker cut of meat one might get at a butcher shop. Currently, the company is transferring its first commercial product to its first BioFarm, a pilot production plant with a launch planned for 2022.  One of the biggest hurdles for the novel meat technology to come to market is regulatory approval. In December 2020, Singapore became the first country in the world to approve the sale of lab-grown meat and other regions are expected to follow. In meat-heavy Brazil, the deal between Aleph Farms and BRF will prove monumental once the country gives lab-grown meat regulatory approval. “We are thrilled to join forces with BRF, a global food and meat industries leader. This new partnership advances Aleph Farms’ strategy to integrate into the existing ecosystem as part of our go-to-market plans,” Aleph Farms Co-founder and CEO Didier Toubia said. “Leveraging the expertise and infrastructure of leading food and meat companies will drive a faster scale-up of cultivated meat and eventually lead to a broader positive impact. As one of the largest beef producers in the world, Brazil is a strategic market for us. We have been impressed by the strong commitment from BRF management to innovation and sustainability. We are convinced that shared values are the key to a successful long-term partnership.”  BRF currently has 30 brands in its portfolio, many of which make hot dogs, prosciutto, and chicken nuggets from traditionally raised animals, and generated $7.25 billion in revenue last year. BRF will distribute Aleph Farms’ cultured meat as part of its 2030 Vision Strategy of investing in more environmentally friendly practices while increasing its revenues to $18.5 billion by 2030. The partnership also aligns with the broader climate goals of Brazil, which committed to reduce its total net greenhouse gas emissions by 43 percent by 2030.  “This is yet another step that strengthens the innovative journey of BRF to offer a choice of alternatives to consumers, optimize efficiency and at the same time reduce the strain on the production chain,” Sergio Pinto, Director of Innovation at BRF, said. “We are a food company that invests in advanced technology and respects and combines new trends associated with social and environmental sustainability. By producing high-quality sustainable cultivated meat, we can further establish our role as agents of transformation in the food industry, by offering the latest innovations in the production of meat.” "

The latest market data, provided by Israeli market research firm StoreNext, was collected from all brick-and-mortar and online retail channels in the country. The data shows the plant-based protein market grew by 18.5 percent  from 2019 to 2020, while the animal food market grew by only 1.8 percent. The largest growth was in the plant-based burgers and minced or ground meat categories, with an overall growth of 57 percent, followed by plant-based schnitzel and sausages. “My estimate is that Israel is one of the fastest-growing alternative protein markets in 2020,” Nir Goldstein, Managing Director of GFI Israel, said.  Additionally, the research shows that sales of soy-based milk products grew by 23 percent, while other plant-based milks such as rice, oat, and almond, grew by 55 percent. Overall, the plant-based dairy alternative category in Israel, including vegan cheese and yogurt, grew by 40 percent in 2020. "

14648,WORLD’S FIRST LAB-GROWN RIBEYE STEAK IS HERE,https://vegnews.com/2021/2/world-s-first-lab-grown-ribeye-steak,2021-02-09,"This week, Israel-based startup Aleph Farms unveiled the world’s first ribeye steak cultivated in a lab setting. The steak features all of the structures common to the ribeye cut, including muscle, fat, and a vascular-like system, but does not come from the raising and slaughtering of a cow. Instead, Aleph Farms uses innovative 3D bioprinting technology that relies on a small amount of animal cells that are incubated and grown to create the meat structure without genetic engineering or immortalization.  Developed at The Technion— Israel Institute of Technology—Aleph Farms’ new cultivated ribeye steak is a proof of concept for now but the company plans to use the technology to add new cuts of meat to diversify its portfolio. “With the realization of this milestone, we have broken the barriers to introducing new levels of variety into the cultivated meat cuts we can now produce. As we look into the future of 3D bioprinting, the opportunities are endless,” Shulamit Levenberg, a professor at Technion and Aleph Farm’s Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Advisor, said.  Aleph Farms debuted its first version of cultivated steak—a thin piece of meat that did not undergo its 3D bioprinting process—in 2018 and has since increased its size and adapted it to be viable for large-scale production. In 2019, Aleph Farms grew its cell-based steak on the International Space Station outside of the Earth’s orbit to show that the technology can create food sources with very limited natural resources such as land and water. The new cultivated ribeye steak builds upon Aleph Farms’ initial cell-based steak to provide the same sensory experience of a thicker cut of meat one might get at a butcher shop. “This breakthrough reflects an artistic expression of the scientific expertise of our team,” Aleph Farms CEO and Co-Founder Didier Toubia said. “I am blessed to work with some of the greatest people in this industry. We recognize some consumers will crave thicker and fattier cuts of meat. This accomplishment represents our commitment to meeting our consumer’s unique preferences and taste buds, and we will continue to progressively diversify our offerings. Additional meat designs will drive a larger impact in the mid and long term. This milestone for me marks a major leap in fulfilling our vision of leading a global food system transition toward a more sustainable, equitable, and secure world.” Currently, Aleph Farms is transferring its first commercial product—which Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tasted in December—to its first BioFarm, a pilot production plant with a launch planned for 2022. While Singapore is the only country in the world that allows the sale of cultured meat, given the level of innovation in the nascent industry happening in Israel, the Middle Eastern country could be next to grant cultured meat regulatory approval.

14682,THIS STARTUP MAKES LAB-GROWN CHICKEN FOR LESS THAN $10 PER SERVING,https://vegnews.com/2021/2/lab-grown-chicken-less-than-10-per-serving,2021-02-02,"This week, Israel-based startup Future Meat Technologies announced that it has drastically reduced the production cost of its unique cultured chicken breast to $7.50 per quarter-pound serving. The company makes slaughter-free meat from a combination of plant-based protein, cell-based chicken, and lab-grown fat—an innovation that cuts the cost of growing animal meat from cells while maintaining the flavor and texture of animal-derived meat.  “Cultured meat technology is the Apollo program of the 21st century,” Professor Yaakov Nahmias, founder and chief scientific officer of Future Meat Technologies, said. “It required massive efforts of biologists, chemists, engineers, and food experts to reduce the cost of cultured meat by over 1,000-fold in just a few years. We are proud to be within reach of cost parity with traditional agriculture without any need to resort to genetic engineering, ensuring the supply of safe, delicious food for coming generations.” Bringing cultured chicken to market
In 2013, Mark Post—founder of biotechnology company Mosa Meat—unveiled the world’s first lab-grown burger, which cost $325,000 to produce. Since then, a number of companies, including Future Meat Technologies, have been working to reduce the production costs of cultured meat with the aim of bringing their first products to market within several years. In addition to production costs, another hurdle in getting the novel technology to consumers is government regulatory approval. Late last year, Singapore allowed California-based food technology startup Eat Just to sell its cell-based chicken as an ingredient in chicken bites that were offered at upscale restaurant 1880—making Singapore the first country in the world to grant regulatory approval to cell-based chicken.  Future Meat Technologies is also working to get its cultured chicken to market. The startup recently raised an additional $26.75 million in funding through its strategic partners to help commercialize its first products and is working to open its first pilot production facility in the first half of 2021. The startup is seeking regulatory approval in several territories and aims to begin marketing its products to consumers and restaurants in 18 months. In addition to cultured chicken, Future Meat Technologies is working to develop slaughter-free lamb kebabs and beef burgers.  “Cost-efficient production has been a critical focus area for the cultured meat industry,” Future Meat Technologies CEO Rom Kshuk said. “This development is a major step forward in Future Meat Technologies’ ability to provide affordable, scalable, and sustainable products that can meet the growing demand for meat.” "
14781,MITSUBISHI TO BRING CULTURED MEAT ACROSS JAPAN,https://vegnews.com/2021/1/mitsubishi-to-bring-cultured-meat-across-japan,2021-01-11,"Slaughter-free meat will be manufactured and distributed across Japan thanks to a partnership between Israel-based cellular agriculture startup Aleph Farms and the Mitsubishi Corporation’s Food Industry Group. Under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreement signed this month, Aleph Farms will provide its BioFarm manufacturing platform for use of cultivating whole-muscle steaks on a large scale while the Mitsubishi Corporation—which operates 1,700 group companies in 90 countries—will provide its expertise in biotechnology processes, branded food manufacturing, and local distribution channels in Japan. “The MoU with Mitsubishi Corporation’s Food Industry Group marks an important milestone for us, as we methodically build the foundations of our global go-to-market activities with selected partners,” Aleph Farms Co-Founder and CEO Didier Toubia said. “The cooperation demonstrates Aleph Farms’ strategy of working together with the food and meat industries to ensure a successful integration of cultivated meat within the ecosystem, while maximizing the positive impact we make. We are excited to bring cultivated meat production closer to the Japanese market.” Growing meat outside of the cow
In 2018, Aleph Farms first unveiled its cell-based steak, which it grows from a small amount of animal cells under controlled conditions outside of the cow. Since then, the startup has increased the size of its steak and adapted it to be viable for large-scale production. Last month, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sampled Aleph Farms’ cultured meat, becoming the world’s first head of state to taste meat grown outside of the animal.  Meeting Japan’s climate goals with slaughter-free meat
Japan is the world’s fifth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases and is currently working to achieve its stipulated goal of reducing its carbon footprint by 80 percent by 2050—a goal that novel food technologies such as cultured meat can help accelerate. Last year, Aleph Farms demonstrated the environmental benefits of its cell-based steak by growing it on the International Space Station outside of Earth’s orbit, showing that the technology can create food sources with very limited natural resources such as land and water. To further improve its eco-footprint, in April 2020, Aleph Farms committed to eliminating emissions associated with its meat production by 2025 and reach the same net-zero emissions across its entire supply chain by 2030. The partnership will also help Japan become more protein independent. Currently, the densely populated country imports 60 percent of its food due to limited resources such as agricultural land mass. However, producing cultured meat domestically gives Japan an opportunity to feed its 127 million citizens without relying so heavily on imports.   Roadblocks 
One of the challenges of bringing this novel technology to market has been government regulatory approval. In December, Singapore became the first country in the world to grant approval to California-based startup Eat Just to sell its cultured chicken—which it quickly debuted on the menu of upscale experiential restaurant 1880 later that month. With Singapore’s approval, cellular agriculture companies expect other countries to follow.  Currently, Aleph Farms and the Mitsubishi Corporation are part of the “Cellular Agriculture Study Group,” a consortium implementing policy proposals under the Japanese Center for Rule-Making Strategy in an effort to help define the standards around the emerging industry and help slaughter-free meat overcome the hurdle of regulatory approval.

14799,JIMMY DEAN LAUNCHES “PLANT-BASED” SAUSAGES THAT CONTAIN EGG WHITES,https://vegnews.com/2021/1/jimmy-dean-launches-plant-based-sausages-that-contain-egg-whites,2021-01-07,"This week, sausage giant Jimmy Dean announced the launch of what it calls “plant-based” sausage patties—its first entry into the meatless meat industry. The patties are made from a blend of soy protein and animal-derived egg whites and are featured in two breakfast products: Plant-Based Patty, Egg & Cheese Croissant Sandwich and Jimmy Dean Delights Plant-Based Patty & Frittata Sandwich (both of which contain additional animal products). The croissant sandwich is now available at Sam’s Club while the frittata sandwich will launch at retailers nationwide this spring.  Jimmy Dean—which is owned by meat giant Tyson Foods—believes that the launch of these products capitalizes on booming sales of plant-based foods, which grew by 148 percent year-over-year in mid-March 2020. “Plant-based foods are revolutionizing the way people eat across meal occasions, including breakfast,” Scott Glenn, Jimmy Dean Senior Director of Marketing, said. “As the protein breakfast leader, expanding our portfolio to provide people with alternative choices was critical. We also had to deliver the same signature flavor and quality people expect from the Jimmy Dean brand with our new sandwiches, and we’re excited for both our lifelong and new fans to try them.” To create the “plant-based” patties, Jimmy Dean worked with a group of its longtime customers who provided feedback on the new products. “We’re thankful to the loyal Jimmy Dean fans who share our passion for breakfast, and we’re excited to introduce new people to the Jimmy Dean brand as we bring innovations to market to meet evolving consumer needs, like the plant-based patty breakfast sandwiches,” Glenn said.  Tyson’s “plant-based” snafus
This isn’t the first time that Tyson got its messaging wrong. In 2019, Tyson launched its first meatless line Raised & Rooted with two products: Nuggets Made with Plants (meatless chicken nuggets that contained egg whites) and The Blend burger patties made mostly with beef and pea protein isolate—a key ingredient in many plant-based meat products. In late 2020, David Ervin, Vice President of Alternative Protein at Tyson, revealed that the Raised & Rooted line would eliminate eggs and discontinue the blended burger to open itself up to consumers searching for fully plant-based products.

The California brand’s revolutionary meat (called GOOD Meat Cultured Chicken) will star in a three course-meal inspired by cuisines from China, Brazil, and the United States—the world’s top chicken-producing countries. “We are honored to host the global launch of Eat Just’s first cultured meat product,” 1880 founder Marc Nicholson said. “This is a revolutionary step towards solving climate change and creating the opportunity to feed the world without overwhelming the planet.”  Singapore makes history
Earlier this month, the Southeast Asian nation made history when the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) approved the sale of Eat Just’s lab-grown (also known as “cultured” or “cell-based”) chicken, making it the first country in the world to grant regulatory approval for the novel food technology in which meat is made using a small amount of animal cells that are grown into meat outside of the animal in a bioreactor. To gain government approval, the startup demonstrated a consistent and safe manufacturing process by submitting cell-based chicken samples from 20 production runs in 1,200-liter bioreactors, all made without antibiotics, and proving that its cultured chicken met the SFA’s standards for poultry meat. With the 1880 partnership, Eat Just is now the first company to sell cultured meat, which it will first serve to young diners between the ages of 14 and 18—an age group Eat Just says has shown the biggest concern for creating a better planet. “This historic step, the first-ever commercial sale of cultured meat, moves us closer to a world where the majority of meat we eat will not require tearing down a single forest, displacing a single animal’s habitat or using a single drop of antibiotics.” Eat Just CEO Josh Tetrick said. “We’re thrilled to partner with 1880 to launch a product that will someday be served on the dinner tables of families living in the suburbs of Birmingham, Alabama, to the skyscrapers of Shanghai.” Cooking with cultured chicken
1880 focuses on thought-provoking menus and social-impact programming and will feature Eat Just’s cultured chicken as part of an experiential journey through the past, present, and future of the global food system. This weekend’s historic service will be prepared by 1880’s Executive Chef Colin Buchan—who previously worked as a personal chef for celebrity couple David and Victoria Beckham. “This is a very exciting collaboration for me,” Chef Buchan said. “It’s working with new ingredients, something very creative, something we’ve never quite seen before and I think people are going to love it.” "
14877,DAIRY-IDENTICAL VEGAN STARTUP RAISES $11.3 MILLION TO EXPAND WORLDWIDE,https://vegnews.com/2020/12/dairy-identical-vegan-startup-raises-11-3-million-to-expand-worldwide,2020-12-15,"This week, Israel-based startup Remilk announced it has raised $11.3 million in capital to fund its goal of disrupting the global dairy industry. Through its patented process, the startup uses microbial fermentation to create a base that is identical to dairy milk but free from animal-derived ingredients. Its commercial partners then create dairy-identical products such as yogurt, cheese, and cream without the need to exploit cows. “Today’s non-dairy alternatives address environmental and health concerns but universally fail to create authentic dairy-based products, like cheese. We’re bridging this gap by making dairy products with dairy proteins, without needing a single cow,” Remilk Co-founder and CEO Aviv Wolff said. “Our proprietary technology delivers the most authentic animal-free dairy product in the market today and is identical to natural dairy. With our new partnerships for production and distribution, we’ll soon be ready to reinvent this multibillion-dollar industry.” The company will use the newly raised $11.3 million to expand its production and distribution capabilities.  Replacing cows with microbes
While traditional dairy requires more than 1,000 liters of water to produce only one liter of milk, Remilk’s process requires one percent of the land, four percent of the feedstock and 10 percent of the water to produce comparable products. “Relying on animals to make our food is no longer sustainable. This model of food production has all but reached its limits in terms of scale, reach, and efficiency, and the implications are devastating for our planet,” Wolff said. “Remilk is revolutionizing the way we produce food around the world, and importantly, is creating a lasting and environmentally-friendly food system that takes no more than what our planet can give.”  Homegrown animal-free dairy
Stateside, California-based startup Perfect Day also creates animal-free dairy proteins using microbial fermentation. Founded by biomedical engineers and vegans Ryan Pandya and Perumal Gandhi, the company inserts a cow’s DNA sequence as a blueprint into yeast-based microflora—tiny living organisms used to make everyday items such as vitamins and probiotics. The flora then takes the place of a cow and undergoes an acellular (without animal cells) fermentation process producing an abundance of proteins that can be used as a base for “flora-based” products that are indistinguishable from dairy foods such as milk, cheese, and ice cream. In July, Perfect Day raised $300 million to fund its mission of disrupting the global dairy industry and is now the most-funded alternative protein startup in the emerging fermentation industry.

Designed to incentivize teams across the world to produce vegan alternatives to chicken breasts or fish fillets that outperform their animal-based counterparts, the global, four-year competition will award the winning team with a grand prize of $7 million.  Food security by 2050
XPRIZE Feed the Next Billion was developed in response to the nonprofit’s Future of Food Impact Roadmap, an in-depth analysis of challenges to the global food system that identified 12 key breakthroughs that could help establish a more sustainable and food secure world by 2050. With an estimated human population of 9.7 billion within the next 30 years, the demand for high-protein products is increasing. XPRIZE aims to help offer, find, and develop alternative protein sources to combat increasing demand on animal agriculture that would only accelerate deforestation, biodiversity loss, climate change, strain the global water supply, and worsen inhumane treatment of animals. “Billions of individuals do and will desire higher quality protein as a food source, but the earth is incapable of providing this with traditional livestock,” XPRIZE Founder Peter H. Diamandis, MD said.  “A much more sustainable, scalable methodology is required. XPRIZE Feed The Next Billion seeks to create poultry and fish that is affordable, sustainable, more nutritious, and a lower cost than mechanisms now in place. We believe hundreds of entrepreneurs will focus on driving breakthroughs in this critical and important area to help feed the world.” Contest rules
Launched in partnership with Abu Dhabi-based transformative technology company ASPIRE and The Tim Robbins Foundation, a nonprofit committed to improving social welfare of communities in need, XPRIZE Feed the Next Billion will take place in three rounds across four years. With registration now open, teams must register by April 28, 2021 and pay the accompanying $1,500 entrance fee to participate. A discounted registration fee of $1,000 is available for teams who enter by February 17, 2021.  During the competition’s first round, scheduled shortly after the April 2021 registration deadline, judges will select up to 30 teams to move onto the semifinals. The selected teams will evenly divide $500,000 to help offset costs often associated with early solution development.  In the third quarter of 2022, judges will select 10 teams—who will be awarded $2.5 million cumulatively—from the original 30 to move onto the finals. Following the third and final round, winners will be announced in early 2024.  The grand prize
XPrize Feed the Next Billion will award the winning team a $7 million grand prize. To win, teams must develop multiple, consistent four-ounce cuts of vegan alternatives to raw chicken breasts or fish fillets. Proposed alternatives must replicate or outperform their animal-based counterparts in structure, versatility, nutritional profile, taste and texture, accessibility, environmental sustainability, and animal welfare.  Second and third place teams will take home $2 million and $1 million respectively. A bonus prize of $2 million will be awarded to the team that develops a growth media, free of animal-ingredients, at the lowest production cost.  Whole cuts of meat without animals
In recent years, global developments have seen an uptick in the innovation of meat alternatives. In 2019, new company Atlas Food Co. developed a method of creating three-dimensional, whole cuts of plant-based meat using mycelium (a fast-growing mushroom root system). In November of the same year, Colorado-based startup Emergy Foods launched Meati Foods, a brand using mycelium to create whole cuts of steak. Earlier this year, Meati Foods quiety launched its first products at SALT Bistro in Boulder, CO. "

In 2019, Tyson first launched the line with two products: Nuggets Made with Plants (meatless chicken nuggets that contained egg whites) and The Blend burger patties made mostly with beef and pea protein isolate—a key ingredient in many plant-based meat products. The line has since expanded to include Spicy Nuggets made with Plants and Whole Grain Tenders. “One recent and notable change we are making is to the formula for Raised & Rooted Nugget to eliminate egg whites,” David Ervin, Vice President of Alternative Protein at Tyson, told Foodnavigator-USA. “Moving forward, Raised & Rooted products will not contain any animal products.” The new fully plant-based nuggets are expected to arrive in US stores—including Walmart, Kroger, Target, Safeway, and Costco—this month.   While Tyson believes that consumers are looking for blended products that combine plant-based protein and animal meat, the company is also discontinuing its The Blend patties to make its entire Raised & Rooted line free from animal products.  Jack in the Box
In October, Tyson partnered with Jack in the Box to launch The Unchicken Sandwich, the fast-food chain’s first meatless sandwich made with a Raised & Rooted vegan chicken patty. Available at test locations in Nevada and California until December 12 (or while supplies last), the sandwich (served with non-vegan mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomato on a vegan bun) is available in Spicy and Classic flavors in both à la carte and combo formats and is priced comparably to its other menu items at $6.99 for the combo option.  Tyson’s plant-based future?
While Jack in the Box is the first time Raised & Rooted products have appeared on a restaurant menu, Ervin says it won’t be the last. “In the coming year, we look forward to expanding into new product categories and increasing availability through new retail and foodservice partnerships,” Ervin said. “Consumers can expect to see additional plant-based offerings from Raised & Rooted and other established Tyson brands coming to store shelves and quick-service locations in 2021.” "

Netanyahu was accompanied on the visit by Nir Goldstein, Managing Director of the Israel arm of food advocacy group The Good Food Institute (GFI), and toured the Aleph Farms facility with Tal Gilboa, the government’s animal rights advisor. “It’s delicious and guilt-free. I can’t taste the difference,” Netanyahu said. “I have directed State Secretary Tzahi Braverman to appoint a coordinator to serve these industries in order to connect and oversee all the stakeholders operating in this field. Israel will become a powerhouse for alternative meat and alternative protein.”  Aleph Farms first unveiled its cell-based steak—grown from a small amount of animal cells under controlled conditions outside of the cow—in 2018 and has since increased its size and adapted it to be viable for large-scale production. Last year, Aleph Farms grew its cell-based steak on the International Space Station outside of Earth’s orbit to show that the technology can create food sources with very limited natural resources such as land and water. Currently, the startup is transferring its commercial product to its first BioFarm, a pilot production plant with a launch planned for 2022. “National programs for food security are being initiated with the goal of providing the global society with local and secure supplies of accessible, nutritious, and safe food to facilitate healthy livelihoods anytime, anywhere,” Aleph Farms CEO and Co-Founder Didier Toubia said. “We represent here today not only Aleph Farms but the whole local cultivated meat industry, which is working together to stimulate a global transition for the protein sector.” “One small bite for a man, but one giant bite for humankind.”
GFI has been working with the government of Israel for more than one year to help cultured meat gain regulatory approval in the country, where a number of startups are currently developing slaughter-free meat products. “It’s no surprise that Israel is leading the way in supporting this new and better way of making meat. The Israeli government has turned the country into a nerve center for plant-based and cultivated meat innovation,” GFI Executive Director Bruce Friedrich said. “Prime Minister Netanyahu has thrown the weight of Israel behind this new way of making meat. The EU, China, the US, and other governments should pick up the gauntlet that Mr. Netanyahu just threw down, because nothing is more important for the climate than a transformation in protein production. Globally, we need a space-race-type commitment toward making meat from plants or cultivating it from cells. This gesture from the Prime Minister really is one small bite for a man, but one giant bite for humankind.” Last week, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) approved the sale of Eat Just’s cultured chicken—marking the first time a country has granted regulatory approval for the novel food technology. Eat Just will use the cultured chicken as part of its chicken bites, which the startup plans to launch on a small commercial scale under its new brand GOOD Meat. Photo Credit: Koby Gidon "

The SFA has allowed California-based food technology startup Eat Just to include its cell-based (also known as “cultured”) chicken as an ingredient in chicken bites that will be part of a forthcoming small commercial launch for Eat Just’s new brand GOOD Meat.  Singapore’s pioneering step is the beginning of a “space race for the future of food,” according Bruce Fredrich, executive director of food advocacy group Good Food Institute (GFI), which has been meeting with scientists and others from the government of Singapore for more than three years to push the approval process forward. “Singapore has thrown down the gauntlet and other countries need to pick it up,” Friedrich said. “Cultivated meat will mark an enormous advance in our efforts to create a food supply that is safe, secure, and sustainable, and Singapore is leading the way on this transition.” The SFA approved the sale of cell-based chicken after rigorous testing, documentation, and review in which Eat Just demonstrated a consistent and safe manufacturing process by submitting cell-based chicken samples from 20 production runs in 1,200-liter bioreactors, all made without antibiotics. The startup was able to prove that its cultured chicken met the standards for poultry meat and demonstrated a nutritional profile comparable to its traditionally raised counterpart. The safety and nutrition of Eat Just’s cultured chicken was also approved by a panel of distinguished international scientific authorities in Singapore and the United States, with expertise in medicine, toxicology, allergenicity, cell biology and food safety. “Singapore has long been a leader in innovation of all kinds, from information technology to biologics to now leading the world in building a healthier, safer food system,” Josh Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of Eat Just, said. “I’m sure that our regulatory approval for cultured meat will be the first of many in Singapore and in countries around the globe. Working in partnership with the broader agriculture sector and forward-thinking policymakers, companies like ours can help meet the increased demand for animal protein as our population climbs to 9.7 billion by 2050.” In addition to commercializing cultured chicken, Eat Just is building a plant protein production facility in Singapore in partnership with Proterra Asia, the top food-focused investment fund in Asia, to bring its mung bean-based vegan JUST Egg to manufacturing and distribution partners across Asia.  Other cell-based startups A growing number of startups throughout the world are working to disrupt the animal agriculture industry by creating cell-based meats that do not require animal slaughter and use far fewer resources, and many are approaching commercialization. In October, Mosa Meats—which debuted the world’s first cultured meat burger in 2013—announced that it had raised $55 million in a new funding round to expand its pilot facility in the Netherlands to an industrial-sized production line to, eventually, launch its slaughter-free beef to the public. Last month, Israel-based SuperMeat opened The Chicken, a “restaurant” alongside its production facility where it serves its cultured meat as part of composed dishes to gain consumer insight as it moves toward commercialization. Also in November, fellow Israeli startup Aleph Farms moved its prototype for cell-based steak—grown around a plant-based matrix to cultivate 3D meat structures outside of the cow—to a platform that will scale production. All of these companies are awaiting government regulatory approval as a major hurdle to move forward with commercializing their groundbreaking technologies.  “As nations race to divorce meat production from industrial animal agriculture, countries that delay their investment in this bright food future risk getting left behind,” Friedrich said. “The rest of the world should be following Singapore’s lead by funding alternative protein research and working with companies to ensure a rigorous and thorough path to regulatory approval and oversight.” "

The startup has now moved its prototype for cell-based steak—grown from a small amount of animal cells around a plant-based matrix to cultivate 3D meat structures outside of the cow—to a platform that will scale production with the goal of bringing the slaughter-free meat to the public. Aleph Farms first unveiled its cell-based steak in 2018 and has since increased its size and adapted it to be viable for large-scale production. The startup also developed five modules in its mass production platform to help bring the novel meat to market at cost parity with its traditional counterpart. Aleph Farms is currently transferring its commercial product to its first BioFarm, a pilot production plant with a launch planned for 2022.  “One of the big challenges of cultivated meat is the ability to produce large quantities efficiently  at a cost that can compete with conventional meat industry pricing, without compromising on quality,” Aleph Farms Co-Founder and CEO Didier Toubia said. “We have developed five technological building blocks unique to Aleph Farms that are put into a large-scale production process, all patented by the company.” The process Aleph Farms uses mimics the natural environment in which cow cells proliferate to create different parts of the animal that uses far fewer resources than industrial animal agriculture. The end result is a steak that provides the same sensory experience as beef but without the need to slaughter animals. “It’s not enough to just make a protein that will fill the nutritional gap; we need to capture the fullness of the meat-eating experience,” Toubia said. “Meat can be cultivated from cells isolated from different animal breeds, have different cuts, and it elicits different emotions. We see Aleph Farms as crafters of experiences.” On November 20, Aleph Farms will unveil its newest commercial prototype at the Asia-Pacific Agri-Food Innovation Summit in Singapore as part of a virtual cooking demonstration hosted by Aleph Farms’ resident chef Amir Ilan. “Aleph Farms is establishing a new category of meat, imbued with its own culture and a new world of meaty experiences,” Ilan said.  Earlier this month, fellow Israeli startup SuperMeat opened The Chicken, the world’s first cell-based meat “restaurant.” The concept allows for visitors to sample dishes made with SuperMeat’s cell-based chicken in a traditional restaurant while providing feedback to the startup, which plans to launch its cell-based meat in restaurants within one to two years and ramp-up production with commercial-scale plants in five years.

In 2018, the then 20-item Wicked Kitchen line first launched at 600 Tesco supermarket locations and sold 2.5 million units in its first 20 weeks. Since then, the line expanded its offerings at Tesco to more than 80 vegan products across multiple categories, including prepared meals such as Spicy Mushroom and Veg Sourdough Pizza, Toasted Three Onion Dip, Mac Attack Salad Bowl; vegan meats such as Mexican Style M’Shroom Shreds, BBQ Fib Rack, and Wicked Chorizo Style Bangers; desserts such as Red Velvet Brownie, Sticky Toffee Pudding, and Lemon Cupcakes; and much more. After the success of the line, Tesco has made a five-year commitment to increase sales of its meat alternatives by 300 percent.  Built upon the mission of providing exciting plant-based meal solutions, Wicked Foods was created by New England-born vegan chef brothers Chad and Derek Sarno—former Global Executive Chef for Whole Foods Market who currently work as Tesco’s Executive Chef and Director of Plant-Based Innovation. The brothers also co-founded vegan seafood brand Good Catch Foods—which sells vegan tuna pouches, frozen crab cakes, and fish burgers at retailers across North America—and have written several cookbooks.  “Our mission is to help people cook and eat more plants knowing that we’ll be saving millions and millions of animals each day which improves our planet while supporting our farmers and our health,” Derek Sarno said. “We’ve created the tools, recipes and products to make it simple, flavorful, and fun for people to eat more plant-based foods in the UK, and we are excited to now bring these to the US, Canada, and other European countries.” The US expansion will be led by Wicked Foods’ new CEO Pete Speranza, a consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry veteran and partner at Unovis, a global leader in the alternative protein sector. “In my nearly 25 years in CPG, I haven’t seen anything quite like what Chad and Derek have been able to create with Wicked Foods,” Speranza said. “Their commitment to producing the most crave-able, sought after, chef-crafted plant-based foods is driving huge demand in the UK, and we know Americans are ready for this genuine and unapologetic approach to plant-based eating. Beyond that, it’s not only vegans that are creating demand but also mainstream consumers who want in on alternative protein options that put flavor first.” All of Wicked Foods products center around plant-based, ready-made meal solutions and the brand will announce which specific products it intends to debut in the US closer to its launch in 2021. As part of the brand expansion, Wicked Foods will launch “Plant Your Flag,” an initiative that asks fans to share where they’d like to see the brand’s products to help guide availability in the US and globally.

15113,JUST EGG-MAKER TO OPEN $120 MILLION PROTEIN FACILITY IN SINGAPORE,https://vegnews.com/2020/10/just-egg-maker-to-open-120-million-protein-facility-in-singapore,2020-10-21,"This week, California-based food technology startup Eat Just—maker of vegan JUST Egg—announced its plan to build a protein production facility in Singapore. The facility will be built in partnership with Proterra Asia, the top food-focused investment fund in Asia, which will contribute up to $100 million on top of Eat Just’s $20 million investment. The partners will operate as Eat Just Asia and the facility will be the largest plant protein factory in Singapore serving JUST Egg manufacturing and distribution partners across Asia. “Proterra is excited to announce this collaboration to form a strategic alliance with Eat Just for Asia; we would like to help consumers across Asia get better access to the excellent plant-based egg product by establishing a fully integrated supply chain within Eat Just Asia,” Tai Lin, Managing Partner of Proterra Asia, said.  Once built, the facility will generate thousands of metric tons of protein, adding to the startup’s existing large-scale protein facilities in North America and Germany. “This partnership will further accelerate our path to become one of the world’s largest producers of eggs in the next decade. Proterra’s experience across sourcing and manufacturing will be invaluable. Consumer demand, driven by health, food security, and food safety, is creating an environment of extraordinary opportunity for this unique partnership,” Eat Just Co-Founder and CEO Josh Tetrick said. Welcomed by the government of Singapore through its Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), the new project will result in creating jobs and infrastructure in the region. Eat Just plans to open additional facilities in Asia—where its mung bean-based JUST Egg is distributed through multiple partners—to provide a more sustainable source of protein in the region. Proterra and Eat Just are also currently in discussions about the commercial production of cultured meat—slaughter-free meat made using a small amount of animal cells.  “It is increasingly important for us to invest in novel sustainable agri-food technologies, such as alternative proteins, to meet the world’s future needs for food and nutrition,” EDB Executive Vice President Damian Chan said. “The partnership between Eat Just and Proterra is an important addition to Singapore’s agri-food ecosystem and will build new innovation and production capabilities within the sector here. This will allow us to better cater to the needs of the Asian markets, while creating exciting opportunities for Singapore.” Stateside, Eat Just will launch a new and improved version of JUST Egg—which Tetrick describes as “more egg-like than many chicken eggs”—exclusively at Whole Foods Market by the end of the year. The startup is working aggressively toward making JUST Egg more affordable than chicken eggs. To date, Eat Just has sold the vegan equivalent of 60 million chicken eggs. "
15161,US GOVERNMENT GRANTS $3.5 MILLION TO CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY TO RESEARCH LAB-GROWN MEAT,https://vegnews.com/2020/10/us-government-grants-3-5-million-to-california-university-to-research-lab-grown-meat,2020-10-11,"The National Science Foundation, a United States-based independent federal agency, recently granted the University of California, Davis $3.5 million for cell-based, lab-grown meat research. Awarded to leading faculty members of the university’s Cultivated Meat Consortium—a group of scientists, engineers, educators, and entrepreneurs dedicated to the development of sustainable cell-based meat—the grant marks the first government investment in the cultivated meat sector. Tasked with developing cell-based meat, campus scientists note the university—known for its work in stem cells, biomanufacturing, food science, and chemical engineering—is no stranger to such research, which typically involves cultivating cells in fermenters to produce meat-identical products.    Over the course of five years, the government-funded research program—led by principal investigator David Block, PhD—aims to address “the compelling and immediate societal problem of finding new potential routes toward feeding a rapidly growing global population … while protecting our environment and limited resources,” the research proposal states. The project aims to establish a foundation for the cultivated meat industry, address problems impeding commercialization, and train future leaders of the growing sector. To achieve these project goals, research will focus on four goals: developing efficient methods for amplifying and differentiating stem cells; establishing a way to grow cells inexpensively in a plant-based, serum-free medium; creating materials and methods for making tissue structures; and conducting life cycle, technical, and economic analyses of cultivated meat.  The university’s government grant is exemplary of recent increased interest in cell-based meat products. Last year, the Good Food Institute awarded $3 million to universities in the United States, Norway, Israel, and Estonia for cell-based meat research. In the seafood sector, San Diego-based startup BlueNalu unveiled the world’s first cultivated yellowtail tuna last year and has raised $20 million since then for a commercial launch. "
15214,MORE THAN 40 PERCENT OF GERMANS ARE DITCHING MEAT  ,https://vegnews.com/2020/9/more-than-40-percent-of-germans-are-ditching-meat,2020-09-29,"Approximately 42 percent of Germans are actively reducing their consumption of meat, according to a new study published in scientific journal Foods. The study was carried out by researchers in Berlin, Bath, and Franche-Comté and found that a growing number of German consumers now identify as vegan (1.9 percent), vegetarian (4.6 percent), pescatarian (5.1 percent), and flexitarian (30.5 percent). For the first time, people who regularly consume meat without dietary restrictions are in the minority—an important tipping point that means meat-eating is no longer the norm in Germany.   “The social implications [of the numbers] here are potentially quite profound,” psychologist Christopher Bryant, who worked on the study, told The Guardian. “The view that being a carnivore is ‘normal’ is part of the lay moral reasoning for continuing to eat meat. But once that is a minority view, and meat replacement options become cheaper and tastier, the trend is likely to continue in one direction.” Researchers also found that consumers in both France and Germany were interested in cultured meat—where meat is made by cultivating animal cells in a lab-setting. Interestingly, interest in these types of meat alternatives was significantly higher among people who worked in meat processing and production. "
15223,ALTERNATIVE PROTEIN COMPANIES RAISE $1.5 BILLION IN FIRST HALF OF 2020,https://vegnews.com/2020/9/alternative-protein-companies-raise-1-5-billion-in-first-half-of-2020,2020-09-27,"Companies making alternatives to traditional animal-derived meat, dairy, and eggs raised $1.5 billion in investment capital in the first seven months of 2020, a new report compiled by advocacy group Good Food Institute (GFI) revealed. Investments made in the alternative protein space have increased by 80 percent as compared to the total raised of 2019. In its report, GFI identified fermentation as the fast-growing third pillar—next to plant-based and cell-based—of the alternative protein industry which raised $274 million in venture capital in 2019, with investments spiking by 58 percent to $435 million in the first seven months of 2020. Globally, the fermentation industry—which includes companies that use microbes such as microalgae and mycoprotein to create alternative proteins—has raised 3.5 times more capital than cultured meat companies worldwide and nearly 60 percent as much as plant-based meat, egg, and dairy companies in the United States. “Fermentation’s ability to efficiently produce protein could help feed the world, significantly alleviating global malnutrition,” GFI Executive Director Bruce Friedrich said. “Fermentation could enable companies to meet the growing demand for high-quality protein at a cost that is competitive with or lower than that of animal products. Microbes and fermented plant proteins can also provide the sensory experiences and full nutritional profiles of animal products but without the range of external costs that come with industrial animal production, from massive contributions to climate change to growing antibiotic resistance and zoonotic diseases.”  GFI identifies food company Quorn—which has used mycoprotein to create meatless products since 1985—as a pioneer in the fermentation industry, which now counts 44 companies representing a growth of 91 percent since 2018. California-based Perfect Day—which uses micro-flora fermentation to create its dairy-identical products—has the most capital ($300 million secured in July) to date in the fermentation category. “We use fermentation to make the foods people love while delivering the same taste, texture, and nutrition as conventional dairy without the environmental, food safety, or welfare concerns,” Perfect Day co-founder Ryan Pandya said. “But that’s just the start. By working with food and dairy companies to bring a new category of animal-free products to market, we’re building a next generation supply chain to provide more nutritious, scalable options globally.” To prove that its flora-based proteins function identically to dairy, Perfect Day launched a 1,000-pint limited batch of vegan ice cream in 2019—which, despite its hefty $20+ per pint price tag, sold out in less than 24 hours. This May, the company partnered with California artisan chain Smitten Ice Cream, its first commercial partner, which now uses its flora base to create flavors such as Brown Sugar Chocolate, Fresh Strawberry, Coconut Pecan, and Root Beer Float. In July, new ice cream brand Brave Robot—which uses Perfect Day’s technology—launched with eight flavors, which are available for purchase at select stores and through the brand’s website. "
15347,STARTUP CREATES WORLD’S FIRST SLAUGHTER-FREE CHICKEN PROTEIN FOR DOGS AND CATS,https://vegnews.com/2020/8/startup-creates-world-s-first-slaughter-free-chicken-protein-for-dogs-and-cats,2020-08-28,"Biotech startup Bond Pet Foods has created an animal-free, cultured chicken protein for use in pet food. It is the company’s first step in scaling up commercial production of meatless pet food. The development of the slaughter-free chicken protein started by collecting a one-time blood sample from Inga, a heritage hen living on a farm in Lindsborg, KS, to determine the genetic code for chicken protein, which was then combined with food-grade yeast and fermented to produce meat proteins that are identical to animal meat. Once fully developed, the product will have the primary nutrients of conventional chicken meat, including essential amino acids.  “Our initial tests with dog volunteers have been very promising, and its nutritionals, palatability, and digestibility will only improve on our path to commercialization,” Pernilla Audibert, co-founder and CTO of Bond Pet Foods, said. “The science team at Bond is also working on production of other cultured meat proteins made through a similar fermentation process. The successful chicken prototype is a demonstration of our technology’s potential to create a complete portfolio of animal proteins for pet consumption, and beyond.” Last year, Bond Pet Foods received $1.2 million in seed funding to support research and development of its animal-free meat products. Bond Pet Foods is aiming to debut its first chicken-based products in 2023. "

The move comes after a successful test of Cargill’s new plant-based nuggets—which sold out within one hour of its launch—at three locations of fast-food chain KFC in April. After the product test, Cargill debuted plant-based protein brand PlantEver in China, which recently launched with two products—vegan chicken nuggets and beef patties—available at Cargill’s Sun Valley Tmall flagship store, with other retailers to follow. “Cargill is taking an inclusive approach to the future of protein by investing in both animal and alternative protein,” Jackson Chan, Managing Director of Cargill Protein China, said. “We will continue to offer safe, responsible, and sustainable proteins to customers and consumers by flexing our supply chain advantage and global research and development expertise.” "
15584,NEW FLU STRAIN WITH PANDEMIC POTENTIAL FOUND ON PIG FARMS IN CHINA,https://vegnews.com/2020/7/new-flu-strain-with-pandemic-potential-found-on-pig-farms-in-china,2020-07-03,"A new strain of flu that has the potential to become a pandemic has been identified on pig farms in China, according to a recent article published by scientists in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The virus, a new strain of the H1N1 swine flu virus known as G4 EA H1N1, has become predominant in farmed pig populations and identified among workers on those farms.  The study focuses on pig farms in 10 Chinese provinces from 2011 to 2018. In the last three years of the study, researchers collected 338 blood samples from workers on 15 pig farms and 230 from people in nearby homes. The study found that 10.4 percent of the workers and 4.4 percent of the others tested positive for antibodies to G4 EA H1N1, and that workers between the ages of 18 and 35 tested positive at a higher rate. According to the study, G4 EA H1N1 can grow and multiply in the cells that line the human airway. The concern is that the virus could mutate further so that it can spread easily among people, triggering a global outbreak.  “Similar to pdm/09 (swine flu) virus, G4 viruses have all the essential hallmarks of a candidate pandemic virus,” the article states. “Of concern is that swine workers show elevated seroprevalence for G4 virus. Controlling the prevailing G4 EA H1N1 viruses in pigs and close monitoring in human populations, especially the workers in [the] swine industry, should be urgently implemented.” According to the Center for Disease Control, 75 percent of new infectious diseases are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted from animals to humans. Last month, a peer-reviewed scientific paper titled “What the COVID-19 Pandemic is Telling Humanity” was published in scientific journal Neuroepidemiology calling for an end to factory farming worldwide. “Intensive confinement of animals in factory farm operations should be discontinued worldwide for the sake of animals, humans, and the environment, and we should rapidly evolve to eating other forms of protein that are safer for humans, including plant-based meat alternatives and cultured meat (produced by culturing animal cells),” the paper states.

What the COVID-19 Pandemic is Telling Humanity was written by prominent academic physicians David O. Wiebers, MD, Emeritus Professor at the Mayo Clinic, and Valery Feigin, MD, Editor-in-Chief of medical journal Neuroepidemiology and a professor in New Zealand.  “Although it is tempting for us to lay the blame for pandemics such as COVID-19 on bats, pangolins, or other wild species, it is human behavior that is responsible for the vast majority of zoonotic diseases that jump the species barrier from animals to humans,” the paper states. “The alarming increase in the frequency of these lethal zoonotic diseases relates in large part to our human-dominated ecosystem with increasingly unnatural human-animal close contact, grossly aberrant crowding of animals for human purposes, destruction of animal habitats, and vast numbers of highly mobile humans to swiftly carry these diseases throughout the world.” The paper points out that the hunting and selling of wild animals and the massive overcrowding of animals in factory farms constitute major public health risks and that continuing these practices will only assure further crises in the future.  “Intensive confinement of animals in factory farm operations should be discontinued worldwide for the sake of animals, humans, and the environment, and we should rapidly evolve to eating other forms of protein that are safer for humans, including plant-based meat alternatives and cultured meat (produced by culturing animal cells),” the article continues. “Additional investment in plant-based agriculture to grow crops to feed humans rather than livestock for human consumption would feed more people while utilizing far less land and water, allowing for the preservation of vital ecosystems for innumerable species.” The article will also be published in the print publication Neuroepidemiology in July. The online version is available free to the general public worldwide. "
15744,JUST EGG SELLS THE VEGAN EQUIVALENT OF 40 MILLION CHICKEN EGGS,https://vegnews.com/2020/5/just-egg-sells-the-vegan-equivalent-of-40-million-chicken-eggs,2020-05-28,"Today, plant-based startup JUST announced that it has sold the JUST Egg equivalent of 40 million chicken eggs—an increase in sales of more than 32 million vegan eggs since July 2019. The company produces its mung bean-based JUST Egg using sustainable methods that result in huge environmental benefits when compared to traditional chicken egg production. To date, JUST Egg has saved 1.48 billion gallons of water (the equivalent of filling 1,900 Olympic-sized pools); used 2,036 fewer acres of land; and saved 5 million kilograms in carbon dioxide emissions (the equivalent of driving 12 million miles in an average car). JUST worked for nearly four years to develop its egg replacer, which launched in the retail sector through Sprouts and Whole Foods Market in April 2019 before expanding to other grocery chains, including select Walmart locations nationwide.  This week, JUST released an “Impact Report,” detailing the steps it is taking to create a “just food system”—a mission that has been propelled by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. “We are sensing that there is no natural world where the human animal is separate from all animals,” JUST CEO Josh Tetrick said. “There is only this small, interconnected world where every breath of air and bite of food is made up of molecules that have been associated with another living thing. That there is not human health, climate health, or animal health; there is only health.” From now until 2022, the company is working to improve JUST Egg, including in the area of nutrition with new fortifications such as vitamin B12 and other micronutrients targeted to address deficiencies in particular demographics. In terms of sustainability, the company plans to improve its packaging, build an equitable contract farming program, find uses for JUST Egg byproducts to reduce waste, and modify its supply chain to reduce environmental impact. To increase accessibility of JUST Egg, the company aims to slash prices (which it began to do this year) with the goal of becoming the cheapest available protein in developing regions, with a target of just 4.7¢ per egg, by 2022.  “Whether it’s the biodiversity in Borneo’s rainforests, the conditions of an egg-laying hen in Beijing, the air quality in Mumbai, or the food we feed our families—we are seeing that health does not respect the walls between species, political parties, or borders,” Tetrick said. “This view of health starts with our most important choice: what we eat every day. More than anything else, this decision matters most.” Additionally, JUST reasserted its intent to create cultured meat—where meat is cultivated outside of the animal using a small amount of cells—and shared plans for a transparent farm, complete with a living roof filled with greenhouses and vegetable gardens, a solar farm, and skybridge where visitors can view every step of the process.

15772,EU TO PROMOTE PLANT-BASED SHIFT WITH $11 BILLION “FARM TO FORK STRATEGY” ,https://vegnews.com/2020/5/eu-to-promote-plant-based-shift-with-11-billion-farm-to-fork-strategy,2020-05-20,"Today, the European Commission (EU) published the “Farm to Fork Strategy” (FFS), a plan that aims to promote a shift across Europe toward planet-friendly plant-based diets. The strategy is part of the European Green New Deal, which will dedicate €100 billion ($109 billion) from 2021 to 2027 in an effort to make the EU carbon neutral by 2050. The FFS proposes that €10 billion ($11 billion) of those funds be used for research in sustainable food sources, including, in part, meat substitutes and other plant-based proteins. “This is a major step forward. Alternative proteins, such as plant-based and cultivated meat, play a critical role in Europe’s transition to a more sustainable, healthy, and just food system,” Alexander Holst, policy manager for nonprofit The Good Food Institute in Europe, said. “They also represent a major commercial opportunity for Europe to implement a truly green recovery from the COVID-19 recession. We warmly welcome the Commission’s wise endorsement of the need for greater research and development investment into alternative proteins.”  According to animal-welfare group Humane Society International (HSI) Europe, an earlier FFS draft included a commitment to cease the spending of millions of Euros each year in supporting animal-based agriculture—which is responsible for roughly 70 percent of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions. The plan now states that the EU will “use its promotion program to support the most sustainable, carbon-efficient methods of livestock production.” HSI Europe points out that the FFS fails to put forth a plan to reduce the number of animals confined on farms nor does it put a limit on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidies that factory farms receive.  “Climate-conscious citizens across Europe are increasingly shifting their diets to include more planet-friendly and animal-friendly plant-based foods and so we welcome the fact that EU research funds will now be dedicated to expanding the availability of plant-based proteins and meat substitutes,” Joanna Swabe, HSI Europe Senior Director of Public Affairs, said. “It is, however, lamentable that the EU has partly kowtowed to a factory farming industry that is wholly based on a high-volume, low-price production model routinely propped up by government subsidies. If we want to save the planet, we need to stop producing so much meat and dairy … We should be supporting farmers to transition to new crops and production models, to grow the peas and pulses and vegetables at the heart of rocketing demand for plant-centric diets.” "
15808,PLANT-BASED PROTEIN INDUSTRY RAISES $741 MILLION IN INVESTMENTS DURING COVID-19,https://vegnews.com/2020/5/plant-based-protein-industry-raises-741-million-in-investments-during-covid-19,2020-05-13,"Plant-based protein companies in the United States have raised a total of $741 million in investment capital within the first quarter of 2020—nearly matching a record $747 million raised in all of 2019—according to a new report compiled by nonprofit The Good Food Institute (GFI). In 2019, companies making alternatives to animal protein—which includes vegan meat, egg, and dairy companies, along with cell-based cultured meat companies—raised a record $824 million in funding and have already surpassed that record in the first quarter of 2020 with an additional $930 million in investments. In the last decade, plant-based protein companies raised $2.7 billion in venture capital—45 percent of which was raised in 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 alone. “There’s been a surge in investor confidence fueled by durable and increasing consumer interest in alternative proteins,” GFI Associate Director of Corporate Engagement Caroline Bushnell said. “Investors have seen the market opportunity and are moving to capitalize on a global shift in the way meat is produced.” The US is currently experiencing an animal meat shortage after more than 20 major slaughterhouses closed due to the spread of COVID-19 among meat plant workers. Plant-based meat companies—including Beyond Meat (which raised $290 million in net new stock during its record-breaking 2019 IPO) and Impossible Foods (which secured a $500 million investment during the pandemic in March)—are filling the protein void by lowering prices and expanding retail distribution. “This record-level investment will bolster the industry and support continued growth and innovation for the long term, ensuring that alternative protein companies have the resources to grow and thrive, particularly during times of short-term market volatility,” Bushnell said. “The COVID-19 crisis has made bolstering our global protein supply more critical than ever, given the inherent—and now very apparent—vulnerability of supply chains dependent on industrial animal agriculture.”  According to GFI, the cell-based meat industry, including cell-based seafood, is rapidly growing, as well. The emerging industry counted $189 million in investment capital in the first quarter of 2020, the most funding the industry has raised in its history. By the end of 2019, 55 cell-based meat (also known as “cultivated meat”) companies formed worldwide, 20 of which were founded in 2019 alone, representing a 57 percent increase from the 35 companies in operation in 2018.  “Plant-based and cultivated meats give consumers everything they like about meat but produced more sustainably,” GFI Executive Director Bruce Friedrich said. “Most of the conventional meat companies have reconstituted as protein companies, and nine of the 10 biggest have either launched or invested in plant-based meat, cultivated meat, or both. With historic pressures on conventional meat production, we expect to see the large meat conglomerates double down on their alternative protein investments.” "
15981,NEW CULTURED-MEAT DOCUMENTARY MEAT THE FUTURE DEBUTS ONLINE IN CANADA NEXT MONTH,https://vegnews.com/2020/4/new-cultured-meat-documentary-meat-the-future-debuts-online-in-canada-next-month,2020-04-07,"On May 7, new documentary Meat the Future will be available on streaming platform CBC Gem (which is limited to Canadian users) through new series “Hot Docs at Home”—an online iteration of the 2020 Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Film Festival which was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Directed by Liz Marshall of animal-rights film The Ghosts in Our Machine, the film follows cultured-meat company Memphis Meats as it works on its mission of making traditional animal agriculture obsolete. Founded by cardiologist Uma Valeti, Memphis Meats uses a small amount of animal cells and grows it in a bioreactor to create real meat without the need of animal slaughter. Meat the Future will explore questions such as, “Is cultured meat a solution to climate change, world hunger, and the abysmal treatment of factory farmed animals?” and, “Will consumers want it, or is it Frankenfood?”  Marshall created the film between 2016 and 2019 in collaboration with Valeti and Good Food Institute Executive Director Bruce Friedrich in an effort to document the cellular agriculture industry and its potential to displace animal agriculture. “Documentaries are powerful platforms to unveil ideas, inspire empathy, and motivate social change. After spending years making consciousness-raising films shot around the globe, and after the successful release of The Ghosts In Our Machine, I was looking to follow a visionary, solution-focused story, and in 2015 came across the emergence of cellular agriculture,” Marshal said. “The future of cell-based meat is unknown, but its revolutionary promise and journey into the world … is a story that stands the test of time.”  In January, Memphis Meats raised $161 million in investment capital—the largest investment ever raised by a cell-based meat brand—to increase its team from 45 to 135 employees, and to build a pilot facility in an undisclosed location to begin scaling the production of its cell-based meat, a step that will bring it much closer to launching its flagship products to consumers.

The complex will allow delegations of 15 to 20 people to explore how Aleph Farms produces slaughter-free steaks using a small amount of cells from a cow, serving the company’s mission of being transparent about its production practices. “Trust is a cornerstone value of Aleph Farms and we mean it,” Didier Toubia, CEO and co-founder of Aleph Farms, said. “We felt transparency was needed, as consumers want to know where their food comes from and how it is produced.” Additionally, the company announced the launch of its “Z-Board,” an advisory group comprised entirely of young Generation Z (born between 1995 to 2015) leaders from all continents who will participate in nine-month programs to help the company grow its mission of developing an equitable food system. “The Z-Board provides a unique idea-exchange platform, to make sure Aleph Farms is building the right future for our children,” Toubia said.  After securing a $12 million in Series A funding in 2019, Aleph Farms—in collaboration with several other companies—was able to grow a 3D-cultured beef steak on the International Space Station just outside of the Earth’s orbit, approximately 248 miles from any natural resources, to demonstrate the eco-efficiency of growing meat without raising (or killing) cows.

16335,"STARTUP MEMPHIS MEATS RAISES $161 MILLION, THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT IN CULTURED MEAT HISTORY ",https://vegnews.com/2020/1/startup-memphis-meats-raises-161-million-the-biggest-investment-in-cultured-meat-history,2020-01-22,"Today, California-based food technology startup Memphis Meats announced that it raised $161 million in a Series B funding round, the largest investment ever made in the burgeoning cell-based meat industry. The round was led by Asia-based firms SoftBank Group and Temasek, and included additional funding from animal agriculture giants Cargill and Tyson Foods. In 2017, Memphis Meats was the first cell-based meat company to close a Series A funding round, raising $17 million from a handful of major investors, including Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, billionaire Bill Gates, and entrepreneur Kimbal Musk—all of which contributed to the company’s current investment round. “I am proud to invest once again in Memphis Meats, the world’s leading cell-based meat company,” Branson said. “In the next few decades, I believe that cell-based meat will become a major part of our global meat supply. I cannot wait for that day.”  Founded by cardiologist Uma Valeti, Memphis Meats uses a small amount of animal cells to grow meat inside bioreactors without the necessity of fetal bovine serum—a nutrient-rich growth medium derived from the blood of unborn calves used by some cell-based meat companies. Memphis Meats will use the new funding to increase its team from 45 to 135 employees, and to build a pilot facility in an undisclosed location to begin scaling the production of its cell-based meat—a step that will bring it much closer to launching its flagship products to consumers. The pilot plant will also be crucial in demonstrating the safety of cell-based (also known as “cultured,” “cultivated,” and “lab-grown”) meat and Valeti plans to work with the United States Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration to establish a pathway to regulatory approval with the mission of creating a new modern system that is less detrimental to the environment, animal welfare, and human health.  Prior to Memphis Meats’ Series B round, the largest single investment in the cell-based industry was a $20 million Series A round raised by cell-based seafood startup BlueNalu in September 2019. “This investment round is a monumental milestone in the progress of the field,” Bruce Friedrich, executive director of advocacy group The Good Food Institute, said. “This is the biggest investment of its kind for cultivated meat and will help Memphis Meats move toward the scale they will need to get their products to market.”  "
16513,DUTCH STARTUP SECURES $10 MILLION TO MAKE REAL PORK MEAT WITHOUT KILLING PIGS ,https://vegnews.com/2019/12/dutch-startup-secures-10-million-to-make-real-pork-meat-without-killing-pigs,2019-12-10,"This month, Amsterdam-based food technology startup Meatable announced it has raised $10 million in a seed funding round, bringing its total funding to $13 million to date, led in part by the European Commission. The company will use the funds to further its mission of creating real pork through cellular agriculture. Meatable’s proprietary technology OPTI-OX—which is built on the foundation of Nobel Prize-winning research and optimized by Stanford and Cambridge scientists—uses only one animal cell to produce meat in a short period of time, solving the scalability issue of cell-based meat production. “We believe no one should have to give up the meat they love—there is a way to satisfy the world’s appetite for meat without harming people, animals, or the planet,” Meatable CEO and co-founder Krijn de Nood said. Meatable participated in the Eurostars-2 program where the company received a Eureka label, a classification reserved for companies poised to make a global impact. “Our mission is to become the leading choice for sustainably and efficiently produced meat. To achieve that mission, we will need to solve the cultivated meat industry’s scale-up challenge. We hope that the unveiling of our first prototype this summer will show that we are making real strides toward fulfilling our mission.” In 2013, Mark Post—vascular physiology professor at Maastricht University in the Netherlands and chief scientific officer at cell-based company Mosa Meat—unveiled the first cultured-meat burger, which then cost approximately $325,000 to create. Since, companies around the world are working to create cheaper, slaughter-free versions of beef, chicken, pork, and fish. In October, California startup JUST put a cruelty-free spin on answering the age-old question: “Which came first? The chicken or the egg?” when, after perfecting the vegan JUST Egg, it announced that its cell-based chicken was ready for small-scale commercialization at $50 per nugget. "

Led by Lever VC, a venture capital fund specializing in alternative protein investments, a number of investors participated in the seed round, including Saudi Arabia’s vegan Prince Khaled Alwaleed bin Talal—chief executive officer of asset management company KBW Ventures. Founded in 2017, Bond Pet Foods employs the same fermentation technology used to produce insulin for diabetics but instead uses it to harvest high-quality meat proteins such as chicken, turkey, beef, and fish without slaughtering the animal. During the process, animal cells are added to a microbe such as yeast and put into a fermentation tank where they are fed simple sugars, vitamins, and minerals. This produces proteins that are nutritionally identical to their meat counterparts that are used as the foundation of Bond’s pet-food recipes. “KBW Ventures joined Bond’s seed round because we see that their proprietary approach to production has far-reaching implications,” Prince Khaled told VegNews. “The technology and science behind Bond products is in line with our values; we want to back ventures that are commercially-promising and that seek sustainable solutions.” This round of funding will support the research and development needed to scale Bond’s production. Bond aims to debut its first consumer product—a protein-packed dog treat bar made with a pure yeast protein—in early 2020. "

The study—commissioned by alternative protein companies Food Frontier and Life Health Foods—looked at people’s attitudes toward meat, broken down by age and region. Among the 1,107 participants, baby boomers are leading the progress in meat reduction while most vegans and vegetarians are millennials. The study estimated that one-third of the country are meat-reducers and “flexitarians” (primarily vegetarians who occasionally eat meat), and this group has grown 18 percent in the last year. New Zealanders cited heath as the number-one reason for decreasing meat intake, helping to reduce the chance of heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The environment, animal welfare, cost, and the increasing variety of plant-based options available closely followed as reasons to reduce meat intake. Additionally, the study found that people identifying as vegan are most likely to live in Auckland, and Wellington is the vegetarian capital of the country. "

To make the nuggets, JUST is using cellular agriculture to grow animal cells in baths of a nutrient-rich liquid mixture of salts, sugars, and amino acids, which allows the cells to multiply naturally into animal protein without the need to slaughter animals. At a cost of $50 each, the nuggets are ready for small-scale commercialization but JUST is waiting for regulators to get on board with the concept. “We are working with regulators in several countries on a pathway to market although we have not disclosed which ones,” Andrew Noyes, JUST’s head of global communications, told VegNews. “We are prepared to make our first small-scale commercial sale of a chicken product and we have heard from restaurateurs who are interested in being among the first in the world to offer cultured meat on their menus.” There are currently a number of companies worldwide working to create slaughter-free beef, chicken, and fish and once JUST obtains the regulatory approval it seeks, it may become the first company to offer cell-based meat to the public.

The funding will go toward building the FMT’s cultured meat production plant where the company will create slaughter-free meat from a combination of plant-based protein and lab-grown fat—an innovation that cuts the cost of growing animal meat from cells while maintaining the flavor and texture of animal-derived meat. “The worldwide demand for protein is growing exponentially, and the only way to meet this demand is by fundamentally reinventing animal agriculture,” FMT founder and chief scientist Yaakov Nahmias said. “Future Meat Technologies created a cost-effective solution for cultured meat manufacturing that is scalable and sustainable by design.” In 2013, Mark Post—founder of biotechnology company Mosa Meat—unveiled the world’s first lab-grown burger, which costs $325,000 to produce. Since then, a number of companies have been working to reduce the production costs of cultured meat with the aim of bringing their first products to market within several years. “The Future Meat team has developed a technology platform and roadmap that offers the cleanest and most efficient means of cell-based meat production, both in terms of capital expenditure and cost per pound, that we’ve seen to date,” Matthew Walker, managing director of S2G Ventures, said.

By obtaining a small cell sample from a cow using local anesthesia, OKPI was able to grow a 40-gram (1.4-ounce) sample of real meat in a laboratory setting for the cost of 900,000 rubles ($14,027). “In vitro meat, also known as cultivated meat, is a very promising direction in the meat industry,” project curator Nikolai Shimanovsky, MD said. “From our point of view, laboratory meat production has the most significant ethical significance for modern society, since we can refuse the slaughter of living creatures to obtain meat [for] food.” OKPI estimates that its products will be available to the consumer by 2023 and that the price of cell-based meat will drop to 800 rubles per kilogram (or approximately $5.50 per pound). In addition to OKPI, nearly 30 companies around the world are working to create new ways to cultivate meat without slaughtering animals, including United States’ JUST and Memphis Meats, The Netherlands’ Mosa Meat, Japan’s Integriculture, and Israel’s SuperMeat, Meat the Future, and Future Meat Technologies.

The new option can be ordered as part of a prepared Keto Zoodle Bowl (which comes topped with dairy cheese) or as a protein add-on to any dish at the customizable chain. Just Salad’s grilled steak option accounted for 20 percent of all protein add-ons ordered by customers. Janani Lee, Just Salad Chief Sustainability Officer, explained to Forbes that the move is a net positive for the company, which is considering making its entire menu meatless within five years. “This move isn’t about winning guests, it’s about doing what we think is right as a company,” Lee said. “We know that some of our steak-loving guests might be disappointed, but we hope they can appreciate our concerns around beef’s environmental impact and are willing to explore our alternative protein options.” In addition to Beyond Beef meatballs (priced at $4.99, compared to $4.29 for the previously available steak option), customers can order vegan proteins such as Organic Sesame Tofu along with a variety of vegetable options. “We also believe this (offering plant-based meat options) is part of a new movement in environmental responsibility,” Lee said. “We serve over 30,000 people a day, so we have the potential to make a real difference in people’s lives and their overall carbon footprint.” This month, Subway—the world’s largest fast-food chain—is also testing Beyond Meatball sandwiches at 685 select locations in the United States and Canada.

17004,STARTUP READIES TO MAKE 18 MILLION POUNDS OF ANIMAL-FREE SEAFOOD ANNUALLY,https://vegnews.com/2019/8/startup-readies-to-make-18-million-pounds-of-animal-free-seafood-annually,2019-08-27,"This month, San Diego, CA-based startup BlueNalu released plans to commercialize its lab-grown seafood products and outlined its vision for a large-scale production facility—the first time a cellular agriculture company has done so, according to BlueNalu. At scale, the proposed facility will produce 18 million pounds of seafood annually without the need to slaughter marine animals. “We have developed an optimal strategy for scaling up production of cell-based seafood from a variety of finfish, crustaceans, and mollusks to meet global demand,” BlueNalu CEO Lou Cooperhouse said. “BlueNalu will provide products that are healthy for people, humane for sea life, and sustainable for our planet. As a result, we can have a major impact on supplementing our global supply chain for seafood.” The company’s five-phase commercialization starts with research and development and small-scale pilot testing, evolves to a phase that enables market research testing, and culminates in 150,000 square-foot food facilities that can produce 72 million four-ounce filets (or equivalents of other seafood) annually. The company—which raised $4.5 million in seed-round funding last year—is currently producing fish filets and medallions in a pilot stage. BlueNalu aims to begin market testing its cell-based seafood in two to three years with the goal of building its first large-scale facility in five years. BlueNalu’s initial facilities—which will resemble a hybrid between a traditional food factory and a microbrewery—will be in North America, Asia, and Europe with the aim of replicating the facilities in dozens of countries around the world. “We are pleased that consumers world-wide are embracing alternative proteins,” Cooperhouse said. “BlueNalu is excited to announce that large-scale production of cell-based seafood is achievable in the near term.” BlueNalu’s advisory board boasts a number of highly respected industry experts, including Pierre-Yves Cousteau—a global environmental consultant and president of Cousteau Divers, an organization dedicated to continue the goals of his late father, world-renowned ocean conservationist Jacques Cousteau.

The soy-based product line includes breakfast patties (in original and maple flavors); burger patties (one that is “Simply Seasoned” and another stuffed with dairy-free cheddar alternative); and meatballs (in “Homestyle” and Italian flavors, the latter made with dairy-free Parmesan alternative). The line also features two flavors of “starters” (Simply Seasoned and Mild Italian), plant-based meat crumbles which can be added to recipes for a boost of plant-based protein. “We’ve been exploring the alternative protein space, and have taken our time to get it right,” John Pauley, Chief Commercial Officer for Smithfield Foods, said. “With this launch, we are bringing together our expertise in creating market-leading food products, our organizational commitment to sustainability, and our deep understanding of ‘flexitarian’ consumers, to deliver a broad variety of flavorful plant-based protein choices that consumers want and can afford at a great value.” Smithfield Foods’ competitors Tyson Foods and Perdue have both developed lines to target so-called “flexitarians.” However, unlike Smithfield Foods, the meat brands formulated their new lines with animal products such as eggs and beef, effectively cutting out a segment of consumers looking for fully plant-based options. Smithfield Foods’ plant-based meat line will be packed in trays that are made from more than 50-percent recycled materials and available in the refrigerated section of grocery stores nationwide.  "

Mosa Meats co-founder Mark Post created the first lab-grown beef burger (using a small amount of animal cells grown in a lab setting) in 2013 at a cost of €250,000 ($280,400)—funded by Google co-founder Sergey Brin—but Mosa Meat and Biotech Foods say production costs have fallen dramatically since then. The average cost of producing a kilogram of lab-grown meat (also known as cultured meat) is now about €100 ($112) which is significantly lower than the $800 cited a year ago by Israeli biotech company Future Meat Technologies. “The burger was this expensive in 2013 because back then it was novel science and we were producing at a very small scale,” a Mosa Meat spokeswoman told media outlet Reuters. “Once production is scaled up, we project the cost of producing a hamburger will be around €9 ($10).” And they could ultimately become even cheaper than a conventional burger, the spokesperson said. A number of companies have invested in research and development of lab-grown meat in recent years. Biotech Foods hopes to reach production scale of its meat and have regulatory approval by 2021, when it expects to begin generating revenue. Earlier this year, animal agriculture feed supplier Cargill announced its investment in lab-grown meat company Aleph Foods to help the startup brings its slaughter-free steak to market. "

The contest is open to dogs one year or older of any breed (mutts are encouraged), and entrants must know basic commands and be potty trained. To enter, human companions must follow Wild Earth on Instagram, post at least one photo of the dog on social media with a reason why he or she would best represent Wild Earth, accompanied by #WEDogModelSearch and a @WildEarthPets tag. The winning dog, his/her companion, and a friend will be flown to Los Angeles for a free, three-day hotel stay for the launch of Wild Earth’s dog food, along with a free supply of the new food for the dog’s lifetime. “Even though we are calling it a dog ‘model’ contest, we are looking for a dog with a great story and are not just judging by looks,” Florian Radke, Chief Marketing Officer at Wild Earth, told VegNews. “We are looking for dogs that have personality and dog parents that really believe in Wild Earth’s mission of healthy and clean dog food for happier puppies and a better planet.” In addition to its upcoming dog food, the company developed dog treats made from cultured koji (a type of fungus it grows in a lab-setting using a proprietary process) and is working on cell-based mouse meat for cats. “The pet food industry is a key driver of environmental degradation caused by animal agriculture. We need new and alternative proteins to feed the billion plus pets globally, and also to minimize the environmental impact of feeding that growing population,” Wild Earth CEO Ryan Bethencourt told VegNews. “Given the shocking amount of animal farming required for pet food, alternative proteins for dogs (and cats) represent an important component of a more sustainable and humane food system.” Wild Earth’s dog model contest is open until June 28 and winners—including 10 finalists who will be awarded a Whistle 3 GPS and activity tracker—will be chosen by a panel of judges by July 1.

The Future of Plant-Based Proteins Conference will highlight the latest developments and barriers in the rapidly expanding plant-based protein market. In the media outlet’s annual survey, participants revealed that six percent of alternative proteins affected their businesses in 2017, and 61 percent were in favor of seeing more content on alternative proteins in the future. The one-day conference will bring together industry leaders from across the globe to present a range of topics on the growing trend, as well as how it will influence the future opportunities of the international meat sector. One of the speakers invited to present is Nicole Sopko, vice president of vegan brand Upton’s Naturals, which pioneered flavored seitan and kickstarted the jackfruit food trend in the United States. Sopko’s speech will cover the changing marketplace, how to build a plant-based brand and market it internationally, along with the growing popularity of jackfruit as a whole-food meat alternative. “I’m looking forward to taking part in The Future of Plant-Based Proteins conference to discuss my work with Upton’s Naturals,” Nicole Sopko, VP of Upton’s Naturals, told VegNews. “So far I’ve been very impressed with Global Meat News’ commitment to expanding education into the area of meat alternatives. They’ve recognized the growing demand for vegan and plant-based foods and are helping the industry to deliver meat-free options to consumers. To us, this further shows how far the category has come and how much potential there is for the future. As interest in meat alternatives increases globally, there will be more events of this variety and The Future of Plant-Based Proteins is leading the way.” Photo Credit: Upton’s Naturals "
17341,TYSON DEBUTS “PLANT-BASED” CHICKEN NUGGETS MADE WITH EGG,https://vegnews.com/2019/6/tyson-debuts-plant-based-chicken-nuggets-made-with-egg,2019-06-13,"This week, meat giant Tyson Foods announced the launch of its Raised & Rooted line focusing on offering “great-tasting plant-based and blended foods that are rooted in how people eat today.” The two products Tyson initially added to the line include The Blend burger patties made mostly with beef and pea protein isolate—a key ingredient in many plant-based meat products—and Nuggets Made with Plants, meatless nuggets that contain egg whites. “While most Americans still choose meat as their primary source of protein, interest in plant and blended proteins is growing significantly,” Noelle O’Mara, Tyson Foods’ chief marketing officer, said. “These products appeal to a broad cross section of consumers who enjoy food from a variety of protein sources, and we expect interest to continue to grow across protein types.” Tyson previously held a 6.5 percent stake in Beyond Meat and sold its stake in the vegan company to pursue its own plant-based alternatives—which it has yet to add to its new line. “The Raised & Rooted launch and our pipeline of innovation will reflect our consumers expectations for 100-percent plant-based, blended, and traditional protein offerings,” O’Mara said. Animal-rights organization Compassion Over Killing (COK) critiqued Tyson’s new products, which, while capitalizing on the growing trend of plant-based foods, fail to fill consumer demand in that space. “Though Tyson said these ‘innovations’ make it the largest meat producer to enter the alternative protein space, we can’t help but wonder if a vegetarian item and animal meat burger really count,” COK stated. “The company’s use of egg whites in this new product contributes to massive suffering on factory farms, where gentle hens are confined to tiny wire cages unable to stretch their wings or walk. Hens and cows deserve better, and even with this attempt to join the alternative protein space, Tyson is falling behind.” "

Kearny. The 20-page report outlines how the rapid development of novel vegan meat (such as products made by Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat) and cultured (also known as “lab-grown”) meat alternatives, combined with the growing awareness of the vast downsides of animal agriculture, will result in a massive shift away from animal products as the human population grows to 10 billion by 2050. “All in all, cultured meat and new meat-replacement products are going to disrupt the [$1 trillion] conventional meat industry with all its supplier companies,” the report stated. “This disruption is supported by a general shift toward consumption of non-meat proteins (for example, legumes and nuts) as a consequence of new lifestyle trends, all aimed at a more sustainable and healthier diet, as well as regulatory measures against conventional meat.” Based on its extensive industry knowledge and relevant research, A.T. Kearny predicts that in 2040, meat consumption will be broken down into three main categories, with 35 percent of consumers opting for cell-based meat, 25 percent eating novel vegan meat, and 40 percent continuing to consume animal meat but from a “niche” market that will be focused on “welfare-oriented” animal farms. “Worthwhile to note is that new biotechnology methods will disrupt not only the meat industry but the complete food industry as products such as milk, egg white, gelatin, and fish can be created with similar technology,” the report stated. Impossible Foods aims to replace all animal products with plant-based alternatives by 2035—the year that A.T. Kearny predicts a quarter of the world population will be consuming novel vegan products. A.T. Kearny advises that businesses start considering this forthcoming shift and investing in these growing market sectors accordingly.   "

The Series A investment round included an $11 million investment from VegInvest, a venture capital firm that supports early-stage companies striving to replace the use of animals in the food system and other industries. Current investments by VegInvest also include vegan companies such as JUST and Veggie Grill. “Wild Earth and VegInvest share a foundation of values and innovation in this effort to achieve a food system that works better for people, the planet, and animals,” Wild Earth CEO Ryan Bethencourt said. “Their experience helping future-of-food companies reach the market will absolutely increase our timeline for commercial availability of our dog food with fungi protein.” Similar to innovative food companies creating cultured meat for human consumption, Wild Earth is developing high-protein foods for companion animals that are healthier, better for the environment, and more humane than conventional products. Last year, the startup received $450,000 in funding from billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel—co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook—which was used to expand distribution of its current products. Wild Earth expects its new dry kibble dog food formula to become available later this year. "

The fast-food chain—notorious for its donations to anti-LGBTQ causes—has been exploring meat alternatives more closely after competitors such as Burger King and Carl’s Jr. updated their menus with plant-based burgers. “We’re definitely aware, and I would say we’re always interested in, what’s happening in food,” Norris told Business Insider. “Specifically … a vegetarian option or a vegan option is something we’re looking at, we’re thinking about, and have [done] some [research and development].” Norris revealed that developing menu items typically takes 18 to 24 months and the company is willing to consider adding a vegan chicken option. “I think it goes back to how far will our customers want us to go,” Norris said. “We’re certainly wanting to broaden our thinking … we think it is certainly beyond just no meat on salads or no meat in a wrap. It might be some kind of alternative protein on a sandwich.” Earlier this month, Dunkin’ (formerly Dunkin’ Donuts) CEO David Hoffman revealed that the chain is also considering adding vegan meat to its menu after observing the growing popularity of Beyond Meat.

While IKEA already offers a vegan Swedish meatball, the new item is being developed to keep up with the current trends in the plant-based meat space. “It is a really exciting industry. Looking at the quality of the products that we have been tasting, I am looking forward to serving a delicious plant-based meatball made from alternative protein at IKEA,” Michael La Cour, managing director at IKEA Food Services AB, said. “I hope that the many meatball lovers out there will like it as well.” IKEA is working with industry experts to develop its new meatball which will be offered in addition to the vegan meatballs already served on its menu. “We know that the IKEA meatballs are loved by the many people and for years the meatballs have been the most popular dish in our restaurants,” La Cour said. “We see a growing demand from our customers to have access to more sustainable food options and we want to meet that need. Our ambition is to make healthier and more sustainable eating easy, desirable, and affordable, without compromising on taste and texture.” IKEA aims to test its newest vegan meatball with the public starting early next year with the goal of adding the item to its global menu shortly thereafter. Last year, IKEA added a new vegan hot dog to its bistro menus (which it now sells in packages of 10 in its market section).

Tyson Ventures invested a total of $23 million in Beyond Meat, making its first investment in 2016 in exchange for five percent of the vegan company, with an increase in its holdings to 6.5 percent the following year. The sale of Tyson’s shares comes as Beyond Meat readies to become the first publicly traded vegan meat company. While Tyson did not disclose the amount for which it sold its shares, based on Beyond Meat’s potential valuation of $1.2 billion, Tyson’s shares would have been worth approximately $79 million. “Tyson Ventures is pleased with the investment in Beyond Meat and has decided the time is right to exit,” Tyson spokesman Worth Sparkman told Reuters. “[Tyson] plans to launch an alternative protein product soon with market testing anticipated this summer.” During a shareholder meeting in February, Tyson CEO Noel White teased its upcoming plant-based meat line, stating that the company plans to “do it in a significant way.” Beyond Meat aims to price its shares between $19 and $21 and will hit NASDAQ under the ticker “BYND” as early as the first week of May.

During a shareholder meeting last week, Tyson CEO Noel White spoke about the growth of the plant-based meat industry, predicting that demand for alternatives to chicken, beef, and cheese will continue to grow. “What I was signaling today is that it is coming,” White said about the company’s meat alternatives. “And we will do it in a significant way.” Noel described the forthcoming products—more information about which Tyson will announce in the coming weeks—as “great tasting protein alternatives that are more accessible for everyone.” White revealed that Tyson has been using its resources to develop in-house products that will capitalize on the plant-based boom. “We have teams of people committed to bringing these products to market quickly,” White said. “It’s an area that we are investing in sizably and we will be in market this calendar year—and maybe sooner than you think.” In September, Tom Mastrobuoni—Chief Financial Officer of Tyson Ventures, the meat company’s investment arm—appeared as a panelist during the Good Food Conference to discuss the reasoning behind the meat brand’s recent investments, which include vegan brand Beyond Meat, and cell-based startup Memphis Meats and Future Meat Technologies. “To thrive and adapt to consumer trends, new industries need competition and, well, a little controversy. But in the end, there’s common ground between us and those who don’t always support our business—the need to feed our growing world population more sustainably,” Mastrobuoni said, adding that “[Tyson is] willing to participate in [its] own disruption by investing in alternative proteins.” "
18170,STARTUP ALEPH FARMS UNVEILS FIRST SLAUGHTER-FREE 3D STEAK,https://vegnews.com/2018/12/startup-aleph-farms-unveils-first-slaughter-free-3d-steak,2018-12-13,"This week, Israel-based food technology startup Aleph Farms successfully created a slaughter-free version of “minute steak”—a thin cut of beef that cooks in one minute. The company used a proprietary technology developed in partnership with Israel Institute of Technology that allows it to grow three-dimensional meat from a painlessly extracted sample of animal cells in a laboratory setting. “We’re shaping the future of the meat industry—literally,” Didier Toubia, Co-Founder and CEO of Aleph Farms, said. Currently, one of the challenges of growing a variety of slaughter-free meat (also known as cell-based, clean, and cultured meat) is creating a multicellular structure that mimics more toothsome cuts of its traditionally produced counterparts. “Making a patty or a sausage from cells cultured outside the animal is challenging enough, imagine how difficult it is to create a whole-muscle steak,” Toubia said. “At Aleph Farms, this is not science fiction. We’ve transformed the vision into reality by growing a steak under controlled conditions. The initial products are still relatively thin, but the technology we developed marks a true breakthrough and a great leap forward in producing a cell-grown steak.” While mass availability of slaughter-free meat is likely several years in the future, approximately 30 companies around the world are working to bring their flagship clean-meat products to market—with Aleph aiming for a limited launch of its products between 2021 and 2022. This week, Silicon Valley startup JUST partnered with Japanese meat farm Toriyama to to develop slaughter-free versions of wagyu beef and aims to be the first to debut a clean-meat product, likely chicken, on a restaurant menu outside of the United States by the end of the year.

The soy-based seafood alternative is available in 5-ounce cans in flavors such as Spring Water with Sea Salt, Lemon Pepper, and Spicy Sriracha, and 3-ounce, single-serve pouches in Lemon Pepper, Thai Sweet Chili, and Sesame Ginger. TUNO was developed over five years in collaboration with seafood industry experts in an effort to create a sustainable replacement for tuna fish, whose population has been significantly depleted due to overfishing. “We recognize that seafood is not an endless resource,” ANF founder J. Douglas Hines said. “If our planet’s resources are not guarded and supplemented with alternative proteins, our future generations will not enjoy simple lifestyle requirements as basic as protein.” TUNO can now be ordered online on Amazon and will be available in December at select retailers such as Walmart, Safeway, Sprouts, Price Chopper, and Save Mart. Linda Loma joins other plant-based brands such as Ocean Hugger Foods and Good Catch Foods in offering sustainable, fish-free seafood alternatives. "

The company co-owner Grant Howie developed the new plant-based product—made with mushrooms, tomato, almonds, coconut oil, and soy protein—after his vegan daughter alerted him to the growing demand for vegan products. “We are seeing a significant rise in global demand for alternative proteins, and the New Zealand market is now experiencing a massive increase in vegan and flexitarian consumers,” Howie said. “It’s this new flexitarian consumer segment that we are primarily targeting, although, of course, vegans and vegetarians will also be key consumers.” The brand plans to debut a line of products in 2019 made with its plant-based meat, including burgers, sausages, and ready-made meals. Several global meat companies have recently developed proprietary vegan products, including United States-based Tyson Foods, which plans to launch its plant-based snack brand Green Street by the end of the year.

Using AutoCAD software, the machine can produce up to a quarter-pound of meatless steak in 30 to 50 minutes from a protein-based paste that is inserted using a syringe. The product is designed to combat the environmental effects of meat production. “I use techniques that are normally used for cultured meat, and techniques borrowed from bioprinting and adapted for use with materials for plant-based meat,” Scionti told Spanish newspaper El Pais. Scionti has already approached restaurant owners about selling the 3D-printed meat to customers but admits more work is needed to make the meat look appetizing. “Its appearance can be improved with an investment of time and new prototypes since this aspect is very important from the consumer’s point of view,” Scionti said. He also plans to present the project to the World Food Organization because the meat can be produced with specific properties to combat malnutrition. Earlier this year, Oded Shoseyov, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, created Chef-It, a machine prototype that prints and cooks veggie burgers on demand. "

During the conference, Mastrobuoni explained the motivation behind Tyson’s recent investments, which include vegan brand Beyond Meat, and clean-meat companies Future Meat Technologies and Memphis Meats. “I’ll go ahead and mention the elephant in the room: Not everyone at the Good Food Conference was happy to see representatives from the largest producer of animal protein in the US, and that’s okay,” Mastrobuoni said in a blog post following the conference. “To thrive and adapt to consumer trends, new industries need competition and, well, a little controversy. But in the end, there’s common ground between us and those who don’t always support our business—the need to feed our growing world population more sustainably.” Mastrobuoni explained that “alternative proteins” (meat made using methods outside of traditional animal agriculture) will play a vital role in feeding the booming world population, which the United Nations predicts will increase by 30 percent, reaching 9.8 billion by 2050. “We don’t have all the answers. Nobody does,” Mastrobuoni said. “But we’re willing to participate in our own disruption by investing in alternative proteins, focusing on long-term sustainability, and working to provide consumers with the products they want.” Prior from stepping down as Tyson’s CEO this month, Tom Hayes explained his position on the burgeoning clean-meat industry—which currently includes 27 companies, some of which plan to debut their flagship products by the end of 2018. “If we can grow meat without an animal,” Hayes said, “why wouldn’t we?” "

The meat exec revealed that, while the plant-based products had “a ways to go in terms of texture,” he thought that both tasted very similar to their animal-based counterparts. “The flavor I’d say was close,” Sutton told meat industry publication Pork Business, noting that he believed that the sauces and condiments served with the plant-based options augmented their flavor. While the meat industry has long discredited vegan alternatives as “shamburgers” and “fake meat,” the popularity of products such as the Beyond Sausage and Impossible Burger have forced those who champion meat products to consider vegan companies as viable competitors. “This good food movement is not a trend, it’s the reality of what our new customer—mainly the millennial—is expecting of us,” Brett Kaysen, another executive at NPB, said. “There’s no doubt alternative proteins are going to play the sustainability card. It’s the cost of doing business today.” "

While cultured meat is not yet available to consumers, the report predicts that the industry—which includes research and development—will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of four percent during the forecast period. By 2021, North America is slated to account for the most active region in the production and potential consumption of cultured meat due to the presence of companies such as JUST and Memphis Meats—each working to bring its flagship product to market by 2018 and 2021, respectively. The report projected that chicken nuggets will be the most widely adopted use of the slaughter-free product—with sausages and burgers to follow—based on current demand for chicken nuggets. Other companies currently developing cultured meat products include Europe-based Mosa Meat (which debuted the world’s first cultured burger in 2013); San Francisco-based Finless Foods (working to replace seafood with cultured meat); Israeli companies SuperMeat and Aleph Foods (which recently developed a 3D-platform that can be used to create steak); and Bond Pet Foods (which is creating clean meat products to target the companion animal industry).

Israel-based FMT will use the investment to bring its cultured meat (also known as “clean meat,” which is created from a small number of animal cells in a lab-setting) to market by 2020 at a price of $5 to $10 per kilogram (approximately $2.27 to $4.55 per pound). Justin Whitmore, Tyson Executive Vice President for Corporate Strategy, revealed that the investment is a strategic move to position the company to capitalize on growth opportunities as consumers shift to alternatives to animal agriculture. “We continue to invest significantly in our traditional meat business,” Whitmore said, “but also believe in exploring additional opportunities for growth that give consumers more choices.” In 2016, Tyson allocated $150 million to investing in meat alternatives through TNV and invested an undisclosed sum for a five-percent stake in vegan brand Beyond Meat—a share it has since increased to capitalize on Beyond Meat’s exponential growth. In 2018, TNV made its first clean-meat investment in California-based Memphis Meats. Tyson CEO Tom Hayes expressed last year that he believes the future of the meat industry may shift away from traditional animal agriculture, stating, “plant-based protein is growing almost, at this point, a little faster than animal-based, so I think the migration may continue in that direction.” In addition to investing in alternatives to animal agriculture through TNV, Tyson announced it will launch its own line of plant-based bowls under its new brand Green Street later this year.

The rabbi’s speech focused on the topic of cultured meat—also known as “lab-grown” or “clean meat,” which is meat grown from a small amount of animal cells in a lab-setting that eliminates the need for animal slaughter. “When the cell of a pig is used and its genetic material is utilized in the production of food, the cell, in fact, loses its original identity and therefore cannot be defined as forbidden for consumption,” Rabbi Cherlow said. “It wouldn’t even be meat, so you can consume it with dairy.” While the rabbi stressed that his word should not be taken as fact among those who follow kosher laws, he asked the audience to consider the consumption of lab-grown meat under the scope of addressing larger food-industry issues that affect humanity as a whole. “Genetic engineering is important because the meat industry is one of the world’s major sources of pollution,” Cherlow said, “consuming many natural resources—such as water and soil—and also because of the moral problem of [the] industrial production of meat.” A number of food-technology startups—including European brand Mosa Meat, Silicon Valley-based Memphis Meats, Israel-based SuperMeat, and San Francisco-based JUST—are in various stages of developing clean meat, while JUST (the makers of vegan Just Mayo) plans to debut its flagship clean-meat product by the end of the year.

The company’s flagship product will be made with Koji (a fungus) that is cultured in a lab-setting, mitigating the risk of chemical contaminants in companion animal food—as was the case with a recent Federal Drug Association recall of food brand Kibbles N’ Bits that it found contained euthanasia drugs. “Wild Earth will be the first to bring cultured protein and cultured meat products for dogs and cats to market that are nutritious, humane, and without the devastating ecological impact of factory farming,” Wild Earth CEO Ryan Bethencourt said. “Using biotechnology gives us the ability to scale and to get a product to market safely, quickly, and affordably.” Wild Earth plans to research other methods of creating clean protein, including the use of animal cell-based processes currently being developed for human consumption by companies such as Memphis Meats, Mosa Meat, and JUST (formerly Hampton Creek). “Wild Earth has found a novel way to deliver protein and will have a great nutritional profile to meet the same requirements as meat-based pet foods,” Wild Earth chief veterinary officer Ernie Ward said. “Pet-lovers want healthy, humane, and environmentally friendly choices, and Wild Earth formulas will deliver nutrition without affecting the planet.” Last year, competing brand Bond Pet Foods launched with a similar mission of using technology to create slaughter-free foods for companion animals and plans to debut its flagship product to consumers in several years.

Out of the total of respondents, 29 percent indicated they would consume cultured meat, 38 percent said they would not, and 33 percent were undecided. The survey divided respondents based on dietary choices and found that 60 percent of vegans, 28 percent of meat-eaters (the largest segment of the study), 23 percent vegetarians, and 21 percent of pescatarians would eat cultured meat. Vegans in the US were more positive to the idea of this type of meat, with 63.6 willing to give it a try, as opposed to 50 percent of vegans in the UK. Bruce Friedrich, executive director of food advocacy group Good Food Institute, believes the results—while possibly skewed by language used in the poll—illuminate the fact that people are interested in an ethical solution to animal agriculture. “For many of us, it is the consequences of meat we dislike—such as animal suffering and environmental degradation—not the taste of meat,” Friedrich told VegNews, “so it isn’t surprising many vegans would be willing to try clean meat—all the taste and none of the suffering.” Friedrich explained that the survey results are encouraging to companies such as JUST (formerly Hampton Creek), Memphis Meats, Mosa Meat, and SuperMeat, which are working to debut consumer-ready meat products made without animal slaughter. “If clean meat was chosen by only the hard ‘yes’ people in the US, that would be an entirely new $70 billion market,” Friedrich said. “When people have a clean alternative, everyone will be able to consider all the downsides of conventional meat production. Once that happens, factory-farmed meat will seem scary and gross.” "

The coalition sent a demand letter to 16 companies—including Heinz, Walmart, Costco, Nestlé, Tesco, and Whole Foods Market—in September to inquire how they will capitalize on the growing plant-based food industry and mitigate the risks associated with supporting the destructive animal-agriculture industry. In its report, the investor coalition—which collectively manages $2.4 trillion—revealed that of the 16 companies it contacted, only Whole Foods failed to respond. “From meatpackers to supermarket stackers,” FAIRR founder Jeremy Coller said, “the global food sector is rapidly taking notice of plant-based alternatives to animal-protein products, and that is driving eight-percent annual growth in the alternative proteins market.” Since last year, FAIRR has worked with several of the companies it named in the initial demand letter to diversify their portfolios to shift away from animal agriculture. Nestlé acquired plant-based meat company Sweet Earth Foods in September, while Tesco leveraged the shift by partnering with vegan chef Derek Sarno to release the Wicked Kitchen plant-based meal line earlier this year. FAIRR investment engagement manager Rosie Wardle said that “business as usual is not an option” for companies that refuse to position themselves away from the unsustainable practice of raising animals for food.

Mark Post, Mosa Meat chief scientific officer and vascular physiology professor at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, debuted the first clean meat burger—that cost approximately $325,000 to create—in 2013 in London. Speaking with Foodnavigator, Mosa Meat CEO Peter Verstrate revealed that the company’s meat—which is grown from a small amount of cells in a lab setting, negating the need to slaughter animals—will first appear on the menus of upscale restaurants. “It will be a statement,” Verstrate said, “not a commercial venture.” The company plans to sell its clean meat product on a commercial scale in approximately three years, when it is able to reduce production costs and receive appropriate approval as a novel food product from the European Union. The company recently closed a funding round for an undisclosed amount and will seek further funding from both traditional investors and the pharmaceutical industry—the latter of which provides Mosa Meat with growth medium in which cells proliferate. “These are real strategic investors who like what we do because they think it might be part of their future,” Verstrate said. Competitors in the clean meat space include California-based Hampton Creek and Memphis Meats (which are working to delivery their own clean meat products by the end of 2018 and 2021, respectively), and Israel-based SuperMeat, which secured $3 million in investment capital, some from leading European poultry producer PHW-Gruppe, earlier this month. The mission of Mosa Meat and its three competitors—who he said might be first to be introduced to the public—is to remove animal slaughter from the food industry completely. “The value of [the] market for meat globally is more than one trillion dollars,” Verstrate said. “Four companies in a shared field is not an issue.” "
19571,IS SO-CALLED CLEAN MEAT VEGAN? PAUL SHAPIRO HAS THE ANSWER,https://vegnews.com/2018/1/is-so-called-clean-meat-vegan-paul-shapiro-has-the-answer,2018-01-02,"Paul Shapiro has been a passionate animal advocate since he founded Compassion Over Killing in 1995, building it from a high school club to a national organization before he left to join The Humane Society of the United States, where he has served as a spokesperson and a vice president. A TEDx speaker and an inductee into the Animal Rights Hall of Fame, Shapiro is a well-known authority on animal welfare and animal advocacy who has published dozens of articles in publications, ranging from daily newspapers to academic journals. His just-released book, Clean Meat: How Growing Meat Without Animals Will Revolutionize Dinner and the World, explores the fascinating—and potentially planet-saving—world of cultured meat. In an exclusive interview, Shapiro tells VegNews why vegans shouldn’t be afraid of “clean meat” and why this new innovation could change every aspect of the food industry. VegNews: There are many things about “lab-grown meat” that seem strange, but the book makes a good case for the importance of clean meat. What arguments for supporting this new industry do you find most convincing?
Paul Shapiro: The problem of factory farming is just so severe that you need multiple solutions. Just as with fossil fuels, you don’t want just one alternative, like wind. You also want solar and more. Similarly, plant-based meats are a great solution to the factory farming problem, but you also want other alternatives, including clean meat. Also, sometimes when people think of new food technology, they think of large corporations seeking to make a buck. But in the clean-meat movement, these are small start-ups pioneered by people who want to save the world in a novel way, and that’s why they’re doing this. We ought to consider their motivations and root for their success. VN: Is clean meat vegan?
PS: It’s not an alternative to meat: It is meat. The cells grow as they would in an animal’s body, which creates actual meat, not a meat alternative. So, clean meat isn’t really for vegans. Clean meat will be for people who are more likely to go to KFC. The goal is to provide a type of meat that meat eaters can consume while causing much less harm. All that said, for vegans who are vegan solely to avoid harming animals, clean meat does seem to alleviate that concern. VN: There are so many benefits to clean meat—preventing animal suffering, improving the environment, saving the rainforests—but there’s also been resistance. What do you think is most important for people to consider in opening their minds to clean meat?
PS: Just think about the way we produce meat right now, and ask ourselves which is preferable: how we do it now, or growing meat outside of animals’ bodies? Today, animals are subjected to torturous conditions, they live in their own feces, they don’t see the light of day, they don’t set foot on a blade of grass, and when it’s time to send them to slaughter, most people would prefer not to hear about it. When you consider how inhumanely and unnaturally meat is produced, clean meat seems like the naturally preferable option. VN: Millions of dollars are being invested in clean meat, but what can the average person do to help promote and support these new innovations?
PS: There’s no clean meat on the market, but this will likely change in a matter of years, not decades. In order to support these companies now, it’s critical that those who want them to succeed discuss the benefits publicly—on social media, for example. There are a number of misconceptions, and it’s important to stress that even fruit and vegetables are products of science—seedless watermelon is hardly a product of nature, for example, yet we still love them. Clean meat does use food technology, but it’s somewhat similar to other technologies that we already embrace. VN: As a longtime vegan, you were impressed with the clean meat you tasted. Do you see yourself being a regular consumer once clean meat is widely available?
PS: I ate it for the purpose of the book and didn’t have ethical qualms about it, but I’ve been vegan for 24 years and am content enjoying a plant-based diet. I don’t have any concerns about clean meat and would be happy to occasionally consume it, but I have no desire to add it to my regular diet.

Writer Elaine Watson focused on 10 trends that will capture consumer interest in the coming year, including innovative technologies such as cultured meat (also known as “clean meat”), plant-based proteins, and cleaner labels. “Growing interest in plant-based foods and cultured meat stems from the same desire to find an alternative to industrialized meat production,” Watson said, “which critics claim is bad for the environment and cruel to animals, and we can expect more investment and innovation in plant-based meat and dairy alternatives in 2018.” Watson explained that while larger food companies struggle to connect with the next generation of mindful consumers, plant-based foods such as chickpea proteins, peanut-based milk, and burgers from meatless brands Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat will continue to gain market share in 2018. A number of research firms, retailers, and media outlets—including meat industry publication Meat + Poultry—have named plant-based foods as a top trend of 2017 and predicted their growth in the coming year.

19670,STARTUP TO MAKE LAB-GROWN MEAT FOR CATS,https://vegnews.com/2017/12/startup-to-make-lab-grown-meat-for-cats,2017-12-04,"New food technology company Bond Pet Foods recently launched with the mission to replace meat in the diets of obligate carnivores—such as companion cats—with cultured meat (also known as “clean meat”) grown from animal cells in a lab setting. Several other companies, including Memphis Meats and Hampton Creek, are currently working on similar products for human consumption, with possibilities to be integrated in the companion animal food sector. Colorado-based Bond Pet, however, has a specific focus on developing better food for companion animals, an industry that company founder Rich Kelleman said lacks transparency, relies on dubious science, and is often filled with disease. “When you look at the tremendous number of recalls through the years,” Kelleman told media outlet Quartz, “certainly a lot of meat proteins are the culprits of a lot of food safety issues.” Bond Pet’s consultant and “pet food” industry expert Ryan Yamka said that the company’s focus on animal food is a large opportunity given current trends. “Pet food has always been quick follower to the human food trends,” Yamka said. “So, it’s not surprising that you see … what I would call the sustainable food movement getting into the pet-food side.” While the company is still in its early stages, Yamka said that finding food for companion animals made from slaughter-free meats on store shelves could be “a couple of years” away.

19683,MEAT COMPANY BUYS VEGAN BRAND FOR $120M,https://vegnews.com/2017/11/meat-company-buys-vegan-brand-for-120m,2017-11-30,"Canadian meat company Maple Leaf Foods announced this week its acquisition of Seattle-based vegan brand Field Roast for $120 million. Field Roast—which reported sales of $38 million—is known for its grain-based meats and Chao dairy-free cheese slices. “The acquisition of Field Roast complements and expands our portfolio in the fast-growing North American market for alternative proteins,” Maple Leaf CEO Michael McCain said. “It also aligns with our vision to be a leader in sustainable protein and create shared value through making a positive social impact. Field Roast has built brand leadership through focusing on quality, craftsmanship, and taste, and its acquisition will allow Maple Leaf to fuel growth in the category through investment, brand building, and innovation.” This is the second vegan acquisition for the meat giant, as it acquired plant-based meat brand Lightlife for $140 million in February. “One thing is for certain,” Field Roast CEO David Lee said in a statment. “We are as committed as ever to the vegan movement, keeping our products vegan, and creating a more beautiful and peaceful world to live in.” "
19882,GUARDIAN COLUMNIST SAYS END OF ANIMAL FARMING IS NEAR,https://vegnews.com/2017/10/guardian-columnist-says-end-of-animal-farming-is-near,2017-10-08,"Longtime British columnist George Monbiot recently penned a feature for media outlet The Guardian entitled “Goodbye—and good riddance—livestock farming.” The columnist posed that animal-agriculture will soon be regarded as an obscene way to produce food. “While we call ourselves animal lovers,” Monbiot wrote, “and lavish kindness on our dogs and cats, we inflict brutal deprivations on billions of animals that are just as capable of suffering. The hypocrisy is so rank that future generations will marvel at how we could have failed to see it.” Monbiot explained that animal agriculture is on its way to becoming obsolete, backing his opinion with several recent events, including China’s $300 million deal with Israel to license its upcoming cultured meat technologies and the development of meat alternatives, such as those made by Quorn, that are practically indistinguishable to their animal counterparts. “The end of animal farming might be hard to swallow,” Monbiot wrote. “But we are a resilient and adaptable species. We have undergone a series of astonishing changes: the adoption of sedentarism, of agriculture, of cities, of industry. Now it is time for a new revolution, almost as profound as those other great shifts: the switch to a plant-based diet.” Monbiot’s belief is upheld by billionaire Richard Branson, who in an August interview with Bloomberg News predicted a meat-free world in 30 years.

20041,TARGET SEVERS TIES WITH HAMPTON CREEK,https://vegnews.com/2017/8/target-severs-ties-with-hampton-creek,2017-08-21,"On Friday, retailer Target informed Hampton Creek—makers of popular vegan condiment Just Mayo—that it would end its contract with the food technology company. On June 22, Target inexplicably removed all of the company’s 20 products from retail and online outlets after receiving a fraudulent letter that claimed, among other falsehoods, that Hampton Creek products could be contaminated with listeria and/or salmonella. At least one other retailer of Hampton Creek products received a similar letter, and, instead of removing products from shelves, contacted Hampton Creek directly to settle the issue. Last week, Hampton Creek announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had cleared the company’s products of any potential health threats and revealed that its retail team had begun negotiations to be reinstated at Target. “To our surprise, Target informed us that sharing with the public the FDA’s conclusion that our products are safe somehow violated Target’s vendor communication guidelines,” Hampton Creek CEO Josh Tetrick said in a statement, wherein he also mentioned that the company’s vegan cookie dough was the best-seller (outselling similiarly positioned brands that contain animal products) at one major retailer prior to Target pulling its products. Tetrick told VegNews that the company will not pursue further action to reinstate its products at Target and that Hampton Creek will move forward in its pursuit to replace animal agriculture with plant-based foods, adding that the loss of Target’s distribution points will not pose a substantial financial threat to the company. Hampton Creek will soon debut its newest vegan product Just Scramble (the main mung bean-based ingredient of which, nicknamed “Jack,” received a Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) approval from the FDA earlier this month) and plans to move into the cultured meat industry with the debut of its first product by the end of 2018. "
20061,HAMPTON CREEK TO LICENSE CLEAN TECH TO MEAT COMPANIES,https://vegnews.com/2017/8/hampton-creek-to-license-clean-tech-to-meat-companies,2017-08-15,"This week, food technology company Hampton Creek’s CEO Josh Tetrick announced that he is currently negotiating contracts with 10 global meat- and animal feed-producing companies to grant commercial product licenses of his company’s cultured meat (also known as “clean meat”) technology. In June, Hampton Creek announced it would be the first company to bring clean meat to market, projected to debut by the end of 2018. The brand produces clean meat using a small portion of animal cells (which, in the case of chickens, can be extracted from a single feather naturally shed by a bird) that are grown in a clean laboratory environment using a plant-based growth medium. By connecting traditional meat producers to the emerging clean meat industry, Tetrick is initiating a paradigm shift that could have monumental positive outcomes (namely, the removal of animals from the equation in global meat production). “Clean meat holds the potential to upend the conventional protein sector as we know it,” Humane Society of the United States Vice President of Public Policy Paul Shapiro said, “a scenario that’s even more likely because of Hampton Creek’s new investment in cellular agriculture.” Shapiro has sampled the company’s prototype and said, “I suspect that a lot of consumers, and the big meat producers, will have a lot of interest.” Should Tetrick successfully engage meat producers—a tactic that would greatly reduce the cost of clean meat production—the companies would use Hampton Creek’s technology in return for royalties made by selling clean meat (instead of slaughtered animals) to consumers. While not without controversy, Hampton Creek’s products—such as its popular Just Mayo—have already disrupted industries that rely on animals for profits, including the American Egg Board, which conspired against the company in 2015 to remove its eggless products from shelves at Whole Foods Market.

20113,FINANCE CEO: MEAT INDUSTRY MUST INVEST IN “LAB MEAT”,https://vegnews.com/2017/7/finance-ceo-meat-industry-must-invest-in-lab-meat,2017-07-31,"In a recent feature on media outlet FoodNavigator, finance firm Aquaa Partners’ CEO Paul Cuatrecasas explained the impeding threat that “lab-grown” (also referred to as “cultured” and “clean”) meat will pose to the animal-agriculture industry—specifically companies that currently grow animal feed. “Executives at feed companies need to take this risk seriously,” Cuatrecasas says. “Even if they do not believe this future will actually come to pass, they need to admit it is feasible.” Food technology company Hampton Creek’s cultured meat products—grown in a lab using a small amount of animal cells—will hit shelves next year, which Cuatrecasas believes will begin a chain reaction for other companies currently developing cultured meat to bring their products to market. Cuatrecasas predicts that cultured meat will comprise a significant portion of people’s diets within 10 to 15 years, and advises that animal-feed companies stay relevant by investing in cellular agriculture. The price of these products—which Cuatrecasas says will be competitive with traditionally raised meat within 15 years—will be the main driver in consumer popularity. “Faced with the choice between two types of meats: one that is cheaper, cleaner, and more environmentally friendly, and the other—which is not,” Cuatrecasas says, “I cannot see traditional meat winning out long term.” Photo courtesy of Memphis Meats "
20133,VEGAN BURGERS SHAKE UP NEW ZEALAND’S MEAT INDUSTRY,https://vegnews.com/2017/7/vegan-burgers-shake-up-new-zealands-meat-industry,2017-07-25,"After a recent visit to Silicon Valley, Ian Proudfoot—the global head of agribusiness at the New Zealand branch of international financial firm KPMG—identified plant-based meat and dairy alternatives as major threats to animal agriculture in New Zealand. During his trip, Proudfoot visited vegan burger company Impossible Foods and several plant-based milk companies, including Ripple Foods—where he sampled the company’s pea protein-based chocolate milk that he found was indistinguishable from organic cow’s milk. “I believe that emerging forms of plant or cultured meat, egg, and dairy products,” Proudfoot stated in a blog post on networking platform Linkedin, “together with entirely new segments of plant-centred nutrition, will become a significant component of the global food system.” Proudfoot made a cautionary statement to the animal-agriculture industry, urging those engaged in producing milk and meat to evolve. The executive also pointed to major acquisitions of plant-based companies by corporations—such as Tyson and Danone—as a trend he believes will continue in the future and result in the increased availability of meat and dairy alternatives globally.

20222,HAMPTON CREEK TO DEBUT SLAUGHTER-FREE MEAT NEXT YEAR,https://vegnews.com/2017/6/hampton-creek-to-debut-slaughter-free-meat-next-year,2017-06-27,"San Francisco-based food startup Hampton Creek announced today plans to break into the cultured meat (also known as “clean meat”) industry. For the past year, the company—most commonly known for its vegan Just Mayo product—has been secretly developing an alternative to meat (including seafood) produced through cellular agriculture, in which a small number of animal cells are first grown in a lab setting and then transferred to a bioreactor to grow. While competing clean meat companies such as Mosa Meat and Memphis Meats rely on an animal-based “serum” (a liquid in which the cells grow) in the production of clean meat, Hampton Creek extracts its serum from plant compounds. “The fact that Hampton Creek has so many resources at its fingertips is very promising for speeding up the commercialization of clean meat,” Humane Society’s Vice President of Policy Paul Shapiro said. Hampton Creek CEO Josh Tetrick told media outlet Quartz that he is currently in negotiations with potential investors (including those from the meat industry) to help bring the company’s product to market. “The entry of a billion-dollar company into the clean meat market sector is a vote of confidence in the technology,” food advocacy firm Good Food Institute’s Executive Director Bruce Friedrich said, “and we hope that Hampton Creek will be the first of many major food companies to dive into this incredibly promising field.” Tetrick plans to debut Hampton Creek’s first meat alternative by the end of next year—three years earlier than competitor Memphis Meats.

20392,VEGAN GELATIN MAY REPLACE ANIMAL PRODUCTS BY 2020,https://vegnews.com/2017/5/vegan-gelatin-may-replace-animal-products-by-2020,2017-05-08,"Silicon Valley-based company Geltor (formerly Gelzen) recently spoke with local media outlet San Francisco Chronicle about its efforts to replace animal-derived gelatin in common foods. Geltor CEO Alexander Lorestani explained the process of creating animal-free gelatin—likening it to a brewery that makes proteins instead of alcohol—which includes fermenting bacteria that mimics animal proteins in a yeast-based mixture. Traditionally, gelatin is derived from animal bones and is used as a texturizer in products such as gummy bears, Jell-O, and yogurt. Lorestani revealed that Geltor is currently readying to debut its vegan alternative—which provides a better texture than plant-based ingredients such as agar-agar—and plans to send samples to interested manufacturers for testing. “The opportunity to get something that is molecularly and functionally identical (to animal gelatin) is really exciting for them,” Lorestani said. While Geltor’s product does not contain animal cells, companies such as Memphis Meats, Israel-based SuperMeat, and Mosa Meat are working to create cultured meat (made with a small sample of animal cells) in an effort to displace traditional animal agriculture.

20506,CANADIAN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IMAGINE A MEATLESS FUTURE,https://vegnews.com/2017/4/canadian-high-school-students-imagine-a-meatless-future,2017-04-07,"The 2017 Lieutenant Climate Change Essay Challenge tasked high school seniors across Ontario, Canada to imagine how the country would stop climate change by the year 2067. Two out of the three winning essays—chosen by a panel of esteemed teachers, journalists, and environmentalists—connected the country’s ability to reduce emissions to a dietary shift away from consuming animal products. Third-place winner Alexander Bishay describes the future as one where “in-vitro” meat (or meat that originates in a lab and does not require animal slaughter—also known as “clean meat”) has become the most-consumed source of protein. “In-Vitro meat, while controversial in its beginning stages, became mainstream by the 2030s,” Bishay writes. “It had the support of both animal welfare groups and environmentalists. As a rising population contributed to rising food costs, in-vitro meat was seen as a sustainable alternative to factory farming.” Second-place winner Yassin Djebbar describes Canada in 2067 as a place where vegetarian burgers have replaced those made with meat. Djebbar describes a future interaction with a friend who orders a veggie burger during lunch at fictitious restaurant Vegemiam. “Watching him eat, my memory takes me back 60 years, when I was 8 years old and ate ground beef hamburgers and French fries,” Djebbar writes. “Back then, we didn’t realize just how harmful the meat and frying oil industries were for the environment.” Djebbar explains that his vegetarian vision of Canada came to fruition through government action. “Thanks to a national awareness campaign and government taxes on the meat industry,” Djebbar writes, “we were able to dramatically reduce our emissions of pollutants.” Cultured meat company Memphis Meats recently announced that its debut products—meatballs, chicken, and duck; all made “in-vitro”—will be available to consumers by 2021. All three winners will be awarded scholarships April 21 in anticipation of Earth Day. "
20625,THINK TANK TO FOCUS ON PLANT-PROTEIN,https://vegnews.com/2017/3/think-tank-to-focus-on-plant-protein,2017-03-02,"Nonprofit sustainability consulting firm Forum of the Future (FOF) recently created global coalition Protein 2040 Challenge. The initiative aims to develop solutions to feeding the growing global population—estimated to reach more than 9 billion by 2050—by encouraging collaboration between key businesses and NGOs in the animal, plant, and alternative protein (such as lab-grown meat) sectors. In its summary report, FOF identifies that animal sources of protein are destructive to the environment, and urges coalition members to focus on developing plant-based proteins to address sustainability challenges. “In the West, we consume far too much animal protein,” the report states, “and demand is also growing exponentially in developing countries, such as China and India.” The Protein 2040 Challenge lays out specific goals for achieving a better food system in the coming years, namely increasing the consumption of plant-based protein, reducing food waste, closing the protein nutrient gap between over-consuming countries and developing regions, and developing indigenous plants as protein sources, amongst others. While the initiative is not solely focused on innovation within the plant-based protein sphere, it is a comprehensive plan to move away from a global reliance on animal agriculture for protein. Current coalition members include meat alternatives company Quorn, chocolate giant The Hershey Company, and major retailer Target, amongst others. "
20694,MEAT INDUSTRY SAYS BIG MACS ARE DOOMED,https://vegnews.com/2017/2/meat-industry-says-big-macs-are-doomed,2017-02-12,"A recent feature on meat industry media outlet Cattle Network focused on the rapid decline of fast-food giant McDonald’s. Writer Dan Murphy posed that, “As far as many millennials now in their 20s and 30s are concerned, the Big Mac is becoming at best irrelevant, an object of derision, rather than desire.” This notion is supported by McDonald’s’ own recent report that only one in five millennials has ever tried their signature burger. Murphy opines that the decline of the burger is credited to a shift in consumer preference, stating that the company’s sales are suffering “as the coveted younger demographic of consumers increasingly gravitates to a plethora of healthier menu choices, ethnic options, and vegetarian alternatives.” Murphy also mentions upcoming film The Founders, stating that it is “an account of McDonald’s rise to popularity”—wherein The Office producer BJ Novak plays Harry J. Sonneborn, the consultant responsible for the company’s unprecedented expansion. Ironically, in a recent interview, Novak expressed his support for decreasing the role of animal agriculture in food production, stating that cultured meat has “a real shot at changing everything.” "

Memphis Meats uses a small amount of cells from a cow to grow muscle and fat tissue in a bioreactor, and the company says that bringing down production costs will make its products affordable to consumers soon. “We’re decoupling the notion of meat from the animal,” Memphis Meats senior scientist Eric Schulze says. “We’re making meat, but we don’t need to feed, breed, or slaughter animals.” The company has already received over $3 million in funding, and recently launched a crowdfunding campaign—which is currently approaching $100,000 and is supported by over 1,200 backers—as a way to demonstrate that consumers are interested in alternatives to farmed animal meat. In a multi-pronged effort to make cultured—or, as the company prefers to call it, “clean”—meat approachable to consumers, Memphis Meats is the focus of the upcoming documentary Meat the Future, which follows the company on its journey to make raising animals for slaughter unthinkable.

Advancements in cultured meat—or what food advocacy group Good Food Institute now calls “clean meat”—have primarily focused on beef cells grown in-vitro. However, Mozdziak’s project sets out to address the cruel turkey production industry by growing 20 trillion turkey nuggets from one pencil-eraser sized biopsy of cells. Mozdziak received a grant of $118,800 from New Harvest—a company which focuses on advancing cellular agriculture—to make his project scalable. “Years from now, when people are [in] the grocery store trying to decide if they want to buy traditional versus cultivated meat,” Mozdziak says, “I am 100-percent sure that cultured meat is going to be just as cheap, if not cheaper.” Mozdziak hopes that his efforts will substantially reduce the suffering of turkeys raised for food within an industry slaughters upwards of 46 million birds annually for Thanksgiving alone.

Both areas of the world have made substantial advancements in developing climate-friendly foods and policies. The first cultured meat patty was developed in 2013—funded by Google co-founder Sergey Brin, along with professor at Maastricht University in the Netherlands Mark Post. This year, the Dutch government placed an historic limit on meat consumption—recommending citizens limit their intake to no more than 17-ounces per week—as part of its dietary guidelines. In Silicon Valley, companies such as Impossible Foods—which debuted its Impossible Burger at several restaurants nationwide this year—have made progress in bringing meat alternatives to the public. “The Netherlands and California are recognized for innovation and agricultural technology,” van Dam said. “Both know the critical importance of information sharing and partnership to strengthen innovation in startups and in the agricultural sector.” This cross-global collaboration indicates that progress toward curbing climate change through innovation in food technology remains strong, despite the potential challenges set forth by the current United States political climate.

The report predicts that global protein demand will reach 943.5 metric tons by 2054, stating, “Developers will race to explore new sources and create new formulations to mitigate the negative environmental impact of the existing protein supply chain.” The report analyzed 20 plant-based protein ingredients and found that three—pea, soy, and oat—will drive the increased demand. Researchers point out that innovation in crop yield and quality, in addition to proper formulations that deliver the taste and feel customers expect from animal proteins, will be key factors to companies focused on delivering plant-based protein products that meet this rising demand. “Alternative proteins will play a crucial role in meeting global protein demands, and represents a lucrative opportunity for a variety of players to address unmet needs in this space,” report co-author Joice Pranata says. Estimates for the total market growth of the animal alternative industry have been promising, with the egg replacement industry predicted to surpass $1.6 billion by 2026, and plant-based milk predicted to hit $35 billion by 2024.

Business journalist Frank Vinluan reached out to professionals in the cellular agriculture field for insight. “People have choices,” professor of poultry science at North Carolina State University Paul Mozdziak said. “One of the choices is they want animal products without animals.” Ryan Pandya, CEO of San Francisco-based vegan startup Perfect Day, revealed that while consumers are not expressly demanding cultured meat and dairy options, market behavior points to the necessity of developing animal-free alternatives. Pandya explains that while non-vegan shoppers are buying dairy-free milk such as soy, they often return to the dairy aisle to purchase animal-derived cheese because the vegan options are not what they perceive as viable substitutes. Principal scientist at Tyson Foods Hultz Smith agrees with this notion, stating that he supports cultured meat research as a way to give consumers broader choices. While some cultured meat companies use animal cells as the base to grow meat and dairy, others such as Perfect Day and Bill Gates-backed Impossible Foods start with plant cells. Perfect Day received $118,000 in funding from biotechnology investment firm New Harvest and plans to launch a range of vegan products made with the help of yeast fermentation—from butter to milk to cheese—by the end of 2017.

Writer Markham Heid says that while consumers are moving away from laboratory-produced foods and those made with additives, this new strain of meat “tends to get a pass.” The article explains that meat grown from animal cells is not genetically engineered, but is real meat grown from a cow—but without the cow. Furthermore, cultured meat takes antibiotics used on animals out of the equation. Beyond health, Heid points out that “the environmental impact of shifting meat production from the ranch to the lab is compelling,” citing a 2009 UN Report which revealed that animal agriculture produces more methane than automobiles. “One thing seems clear,” he concludes: “Unless vegetarianism catches on in a very big way, the world’s demand for meat will soon outpace our supply of cows, chickens, pigs, and other edible animals.” In response to the piece, Executive Director of Good Food Institute Bruce Friedrich told VegNews, “Right now, people eat meat despite how it’s produced, not because of how it’s produced” and believes that once people are offered two competitively priced choices—“meat from filthy farms and slaughterhouses versus [clean] meat grown in a factory”—there will be a “swift global shift away from animal slaughter.” "

22043,NEW STARTUP WILL MAKE RAISING ANIMALS AS FOOD “UNTHINKABLE”,https://vegnews.com/2016/2/new-startup-will-make-raising-animals-as-food-unthinkable,2016-02-02,"Memphis Meats, a bio-tech startup based in San Francisco, made headlines this week with the unveiling of both its first product and its business plan to make animal agriculture obsolete. “This is absolutely the future of meat,” Memphis Meats CEO Uma Valeti told The Wall Street Journal. “We plan to do to the meat industry what the car did to the horse and buggy. Cultured meat will completely replace the status quo and make raising animals to eat them simply unthinkable.” The company says its first round of products will include hot dogs, sausages, burgers, and meatballs but will eventually grow to other meat foods, including pork, all in a process it says produces up to 90 percent less greenhouse emissions and would spare billions of animal lives a year. The business also sets itself apart from other lab-grown meat companies with its aggressive timeline—it says it will be selling in the next three to four years. Similar to all in-vitro meat production, small amounts of animal cells are needed to start the culturing process. Memphis Meats’ process includes using fetal bovine serum—a nutrient-rich cocktail extracted from unborn calves’ blood that is popular in cultured meat production because of its resulting low levels of antibodies and high amounts of growth factors. To move toward removing animals from the equation entirely, Memphis Meats told The Wall Street Journal that it is planning to develop a plant-based alternative to the serum in the near future. The company also gave a nod to its namesake when discussing one of the first challenges it plans on undertaking: distributing to Memphis barbecue restaurants. "
22307,GENERAL MILLS TO REFOCUS ON VEGANISM AND STARTUPS,https://vegnews.com/2015/10/general-mills-to-refocus-on-veganism-and-startups,2015-10-27,"General Mills, owners of brands such as Hamburger Helper and Häagen Dazs, recently announced plans to invest in smaller, innovative food startups including plant-based meat alternative Beyond Meat. The food giant’s venture capital unit 301 Inc. was created three years ago to develop its own brands from the ground up, but will now be utilized to “invest in the future of food,” offering capital and industry expertise to “disruptive” food brands that have a leg up on latest food trends. 301 Inc. vice president and general manager John Haugen identified plant-based nutrition, alternative protein sources, non-dairy, wellness, and fresh, minimally processed foods as emerging trends General Mills are interested in. “If you look at overall trends—half the population is trying to avoid meat and yet there’s a continued demand for protein,” Haguen said of 301 Inc.’s investment in Beyond Meat. “We think there is a lot of opportunity there.” "
22361,LAB-GROWN CHICKEN BREAST COMING TO A PLATE NEAR YOU,https://vegnews.com/2015/10/lab-grown-chicken-breast-coming-to-a-plate-near-you,2015-10-06,"Hoping to answer a growing demand for meat while avoiding the slaughter of an estimated nine billion animals a year, bioengineers at Tel Aviv University say they are on their way to producing the world’s first lab-grown chicken breast. Earlier this year, lead researcher Amit Gefen was granted $25,000 from Israeli non-profit Modern Agriculture Foundation to help launch his tissue-engineering work. The process involves taking a single muscle cell from a living chicken and dividing it into millions of cells to form muscle fibers that, according to the Modern Agriculture Foundation, is “identical in every way to the type of meat consumed today.” Gefen’s work not only has the potential to seriously disrupt animal agriculture but also help ease the increasing pressure put on the environment. According to a 2011 University of Oxford study, cultured meat production “might be produced with up to 96 percent lower greenhouse gas emissions, 99 percent lower land use, and 96 percent lower water use than conventional meat.” "
22650,NEW “RESTAURANT” SHOWS POSSIBILITIES OF LAB-GROWN MEAT,https://vegnews.com/2015/5/new-restaurant-shows-possibilities-of-lab-grown-meat,2015-05-21,"If you thought the idea of creating meat by growing animal cells in a petri dish was bizarre, wait until you see what Dutch artist Koert van Mensvoort has cooked up at Bistro In Vitro. At this “fictitious restaurant,” you can order digital versions of meals that don’t actually exist in reality yet because they are made exclusively from cultured meat. But the Bistro’s offerings go well beyond merely mimicking boring burgers and chicken nuggets to the far reaches of van Mensvoort’s wild imagination—from Knitted Steak and Lab Sweetbread to Friendly Foie Gras and Celebrity Cubes—which is made from famous people’s stem cells. According the website, “Researchers believe that in vitro meat, produced from animal cells cultured in a bioreactor, could offer a sustainable and animal friendly alternative in the future.” "
23694,BIOPRINTING COULD MEAN MEAT WITHOUT SLAUGHTER,https://vegnews.com/2013/2/bioprinting-could-mean-meat-without-slaughter,2013-02-13,"Andras Forgacs, co-founder of Modern Meadow and Organovo, pioneers in tissue engineering and bioprinting, presented on lab-cultured meat recently at Solve for X, a forum for burgeoning technology. Forgacs announced that there is technology in the works that can grow slaughter-free meat and leather from cell aggregates. In addition to using 99 percent less land and 45 percent less energy than traditional farming, the facilities could “be located in or near urban centers … significantly shorten[ing] the supply chain,” he detailed. Successful samples of leather and cultured meat have been achieved, and while the cost of cell aggregated 3D bioprinting is still high, he counters that if bioprinting is done on a larger scale, costs will go down.

24071,LAB-GROWN LEATHER COULD DEBUT IN FIVE YEARS,https://vegnews.com/2012/9/lab-grown-leather-could-debut-in-five-years,2012-09-23,"Lab-grown leather may be available for consumer purchase in as little as five years. Modern Meadow, a firm currently working to develop lab-grown meat and backed by PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel, is revealing that is debut product may not be a food product, but an industry-changing leather product developed without animals. “Our emphasis first is not on meat, it’s on leather,” Modern Meadow co-founder and Chief Executive Andras Forgacs told Txchnologist. Forgacs further explained the reason for the focus on clothing was due to the product’s simpler structure, which is easier to replicate than meat, but notes, “if you look at the resource intensity of everything that goes into a hamburger, it is an environmental train wreck.” Modern Meadow is pushing for consumer acceptance, but knows with only 40 percent of consumers willing to try cultured meat, the venture is not without challenges.

25294,LAB-GROWN MEAT CUTS EMISSIONS,https://vegnews.com/2011/6/lab-grown-meat-cuts-emissions,2011-06-22,"Trying to go green? Lab-grown meat could be the best way to do it. A new study conducted by researchers at Oxford University and Amsterdam University found that lab-grown tissue would cut greenhouse-gas emissions by up to 96 percent compared to raising animals for meat. By volume, the process would use one percent of the land and four percent of the water used by animal meat and require seven to 45 percent less energy. “Simply put, cultured meat is potentially a much more efficient and environmentally friendly way of putting meat on the table,” Hannah Tuomisto, an Oxford researcher, tells The Guardian. "
25665,LAB-GROWN MEAT,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/lab-grown-meat,2011-01-31,"Animal-free meat is on its way to solving the global food crisis, say scientists at the Medical University of South Carolina. Dr. Vladimir Mironov has been working on growing bioengineered meat in his laboratory, currently using turkey cells and growing animal skeletal muscle tissue on a scaffold. The food would be functional, natural, and could be designed into any type of texture or specific meat. Mironov’s lab, however, has not received enough government funding to bring in the new technology. Yet Nicholas Genovese, a PETA-funded biologist working in Mironov’s meat-growing lab, says that cultured meat is more eco-friendly and could become cheaper than farmed meat. "
26745,IN VITRO PORK,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/in-vitro-pork,2009-12-01,"Scientists at Eindhoven University in Holland have successfully grown pork meat in a laboratory using cells taken from a live pig. The cultured meat, dubbed both “in vitro” and “vat-meat,” has garnered praise from animal-rights group PETA and world-hunger strategists at NASA as the future face of food. To create the cultures, scientists extracted, incubated, and molded muscle tissue taken from a live pig. The current product lacks the desired texture, but researchers are confident the cultures will be perfected through subsequent trials, estimating it may be available in grocery stores by 2014. "
27640,IN VITRO MEAT,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/in-vitro-meat,2008-10-03,"This past April, scientists from around the world met in Norway at the first international In Vitro Meat Symposium to discuss the potential for mass-producing lab-grown meat. According to a new economic analysis unveiled at the event, researchers project that, within a few years, meat could be grown in giant bioreactors for about $5,500 a ton if technological developments continue. At about $3.50 per pound, that’s less than what most consumers now pay for hamburger. To speed up the process, PETA is offering a $1 million prize to whoever successfully manufactures and markets the first in-vitro chicken-meat product. Likewise, LA Times vegetarian columnist Patt Morrison cheers “Franken-Meat” creators on for ethical and environmental reasons. “Fewer (animals killed)-fewer greenhouse gases, more available water, more forest, more open space, more available land. I like that recipe,” she says. “And McDonald’s can change all those signs to read ‘Billions SAVED.’” As well as being better for animals, researchers claim cultured meat would be healthier because the nutritional content could be controlled and customized. “Meat weighs heavy with unhealthy baggage,” says Michael Greger, MD, Director of Public Health and Animal Agriculture for The Humane Society of the United States’ (HSUS’) Farm Animal Welfare department.
