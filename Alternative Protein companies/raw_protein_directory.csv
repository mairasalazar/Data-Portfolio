What if we could create dairy-free deliciousness that’s unrecognizable from this center-plate protein, except for its amazing benefits for people and planet?

My Forest Foods,"When it comes to solving our world’s biggest problems, the answers can often be found in nature. The forest is a great place to begin. A lot goes on—between the dirt and the squirrels, and the mosses and the trees—but, what interests us most is what’s happening just beneath the forest floor, where lies a hidden, entangled root system of fungi called mycelium.
We’ve studied and become inspired by mycelium. We’ve learned there’s a lot you can do with it—from textiles to building materials to packaging alternatives, even to food! Really tasty food. Guided by the wisdom of the woods, MyForest Foods is harvesting this new approach to meatless food—one that can sustain AND satisfy all types of eaters. Our mycelium is grown—not ground, so it actually feels like you’re biting into a whole cut of meat.
Our flagship product, MyBacon is the first of many plant-based, clean-label, mycelium-grown eats we have planned.
Mycelium—MyBacon’s star ingredient—is a complete protein with a naturally high nutritional profile, and it’s what gives MyBacon its amazing texture. Our chefs brine each strip using a special recipe with minimal ingredients: flaked salt, cane sugar, natural flavors and beet juice for color. Add a little coconut oil for the perfect sizzle, and you’re looking at a seriously meat-like bacon alternative, so reminiscent of the traditional bacon-y flavors and textures you love.
Now that we’ve figured out how to create a sustainable supply of eats, it’s our aim to pass the plate around the planet, honoring mycelium’s potential to feed the future, one delicious bite at a time.",myforestfoods.com,Food and beverages,United States,2019,End-consumer brands & products,Fermentation,Mycelium,Biomass fermentation,"Burger, Meat & fish",Pork

Deep Branch,"Deep Branch is a carbon dioxide recycling company that uses microorganisms to convert clean CO2 into high-quality products to enable global sustainable animal nutrition. Founded in 2018, the company is a fast-growing startup operating in both the UK and the Netherlands.
The sustainability of animal farming and broader concerns regarding the reduction of emissions are two of the biggest problems of our time. By 2050 the world’s carbon emissions must be net-zero to avoid environmental catastrophe, yet by this point, our planet’s population is predicted to increase by a third. With average consumption of animal products increasing, it’s thought that the output of animal farming will have to double to meet demand.
Of the total emissions associated with the average person, approximately one quarter comes from diet and the majority of those emissions are associated with animal products. Although at Deep Branch we recognise the best way to reduce dietary carbon intensity is to reduce meat consumption, we’re pragmatic in recognising that not everyone sees it this way. At Deep Branch, we’re tackling this problem through the development of Proton™, our single-cell protein.
We have partnered with two multinational animal feed producers to co-develop Proton™-based feeds for use in aquaculture and poultry. Over the next two years, we’ll be scaling our output and working together to finalise feed formulations for an anticipated 2023 market launch. Rather than relying on the conventional protein sources of protein, fishmeal and soy, which are often shipped from South America, Proton™-based feeds can be produced from locally sourced ingredients with 90% less carbon intensity. Proton™ is not just dramatically more sustainable, it’s also cost-competitive, making the transition to Proton™-based feeds an easy decision to make.",deepbranch.com,Animal feed and pet food,United Kingdom,2018,Ingredients & inputs,Fermentation,CO2,,,

We’ve been a leader in the research and development of carotenoid-based products for the last two decades and we take that role very seriously.

Sometimes we begin with an actual seed (from one of our tomato farms) and sometimes we start with the seed of an idea—maybe a health-related concern or even a question that was posed by one of our scientists on a quick coffee break. No matter how the process starts, we always go through extensive and time-consuming testing procedures, studies, and periods of refinement before ever bringing anything to market.
Our process takes a long time. And no, it’s not the easy way to do things. But when you’re fully committed to what you’re creating, you don’t mind putting in those extra hours, days, and years.
All of this work can lead any number of places. Sometimes it leads us to a brilliant and unexpected new discovery like our microencapsulation technique (which keeps ingredients stable and releases them slowly into the body) and of course all-new products (like our vegan-friendly red colorant).

Het publiek dat alternatieve veggie gerechten bestelt in plaats van vleesbereidingen is al lang niet meer beperkt tot enkel vegetariërs. De bekommernis om het klimaat en het streven naar een kleinere ecologische voetafdruk geven het flexitarisme een flinke extra duw in de rug. Daarom ontwikkelen de Flexitarian Bastards onder het moto ‘100% veggie, full of taste’ echte climate changers die beantwoorden aan deze behoefte. De eerste veggie frituursnacks komen nu op de markt. Een gamma vegetarisch broodbeleg en kant-en-klaar gerechten zijn in volle ontwikkeling.

NutPods,"nutpods dairy-free creamer is one of the fastest-growing plant-based brands in the U.S. and is a standout in the natural foods industry.
Introduced in May 2015, nutpods' signature almond and coconut blend creamers are best sellers in their category on Amazon and are now available at many of America's largest grocery chains including Kroger, Publix and Wegmans.
The nutpods brand has developed a cult-like following amongst health-conscious consumers living a dairy-free, plant-based lifestyle, and has become an integral part of wellness programs like Whole30.
nutpods was born out of founder and CEO Madeline Haydon's personal need for a dairy-free coffee creamer. Her inability to find a plant-based, high-quality alternative to half and half lead her to create nutpods in her own kitchen. After discovering her personal creamer appealed to other people, Haydon decided to commercialize the recipe and launched nutpods in 2015, laying the foundation for what has become a leading U.S. brand in the plant-based movement.",nutpods.com,Food and beverages,United States,2013,End-consumer brands & products,Plant-based,"Almond, Cereals, Coconut, Nuts, Oat, Oilseeds, Sunflower",,"Dairy, Milk, Other",

Our algae requires no fresh water to grow, and is about 300 times more productive than peas in terms of production of essential amino acids. Our omega-3 supplements are available nationwide at Whole Foods, Sprouts, Vitamin Shoppe, Amazon and other fine retailers. They are vegan, non-GMO and 100% sustainable. (Clinical studies confirm that humans can absorb more omega-3s from iwi than from fish or krill oil.)

TerViva,"We built TerViva™ to solve the imbalanced equation of a shrinking arable land base and a rising demand for food, fuel and fertilizer. Our solution is to help growers convert distressed agricultural land into productive acreage by growing a tree-based oilseed crop called Pongamia.
Our technology is based on proprietary advancements in agronomy and the genetics of pongamia, a leguminous tree species that produces 8x higher oil yield per acre than soybeans on underused agricultural lands stressed from disease and changing environmental conditions.
TerViva™ is currently working with leading agriculture and land management companies in Florida and Hawaii to establish pilot projects and commercial size acreage – two geographies where the need for a new crop and the proper climate for pongamia intersect.
Native to India and Australia, pongamia is a long-living tree that produces an annual harvest of seeds that are similar to soybeans. On a per-acre basis, pongamia produces eight times the amount of oil than a soybean with a fraction of the inputs (water, fertilizer, pesticides, etc.) and is thus cheaper to maintain while being much more sustainable and environmentally friendly.
We use pongamia to “grow oil”, combining agriculture with chemistry to produce clean fuels and green chemicals -- while at the same time restoring underproductive land and creating jobs in rural communities. Pongamia oil contains long-chain fatty acids that are well-suited for conversion into biodiesel, renewable diesel, high-performance surfactants, and lubricants. Once removed of oil, the residual pongamia seed cake is high in both nitrogen and protein, and has proven value as a fertilizer and animal feed supplement.
TerViva™ has compiled an exclusive library of high-yielding, patentable pongamia genetics from around the world and has developed propagation techniques for scalable, consistent results.",terviva.com,"Animal feed and pet food, Food and beverages",United States,2010,Ingredients & inputs,Plant-based,"Oilseeds, Pongamia",Ingredient optimization,Oils and fats,

Manus Bio,"It is estimated that the world’s population will increase by more than 35% by 2050, reaching 9 billion people. Crop production will need to more than double in order to feed these people and meet the consumer needs of a developing world. With very little land remaining for agricultural expansion, we as a society need to find ways to maximize the use of our world’s resources.
Plants produce a variety of rare natural products which are used in our daily lives as flavors, fragrances, food ingredients, cosmetics, vitamins, pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals. We strive to reduce our dependence on land- and resource-intensive practices by recreating natural processes through biotechnology.
SUSTAINABILITY: We provide a renewable and stable supply of natural plant ingredients through fermentation, which frees up agricultural land for food production and protects non-cultivatable plant species from extinction.

White Dog Labs,"White Dog Labs, Inc. (WDL) was established in 2012 on the foundation of harnessing natural microorganism diversity to address global challenges in food sustainability, climate change and general human and animal nutrition. The company goes beyond discovery to also design and scale bioprocesses with end product application in mind.
Core to WDL discovery is our proprietary Protocol B™ process coupled with additional high-throughput selection techniques for the isolation and cultivation of microbiome-derived anaerobic microorganisms. Our approaches result in large, diverse and novel strain libraries informed through emerging applications in microbiome science, and yield promising solutions for animal nutrition and health.

Lisanatti,"Founded in the late 70’s by Phil and Norma Lisac, Lisanatti® Foods began as P.J. Lisac and Associates, Inc., as a brokerage business that transitioned into manufacturing and processing.
The first location was a 3000 square foot facility that had a cooler and freezer already in place and worked perfect for the new direction. Soon after securing the facility, son Jim came to work, followed shortly by son Jeff. The four would form what would become the nucleus of the company. In time, they would become innovators and leaders of a new industry that would span over 40 years.
The first product was a mozzarella substitute supplied to area restaurants and distributors. Sales were directed largely towards the pizza and food service industries and provided a large cost saving to their customers.
In 1980 Phil and Norma bought property in Clackamas, Oregon and broke ground that spring. In the summer of 1982 their building was completed and operations from the new location began. This would be their new home for over 20 years.
In the early 80’s the company developed a new line of soy based cheeses. SoySation® was their brand. It was cholesterol and lactose free while having less than half the fat of conventional cheese. This new line soon found success with consumers, dietitians and physicians that were looking for an alternative to conventional dairy cheeses.
Awareness of health and diet continued. Not long after the introduction of almond milk, a national manufacture asked Phil about manufacturing an almond base cheese for them. Phil agreed to take on the project and soon had a product ready for the new customer. After several years the customer decided to take their business in a different direction and discontinued their almond cheese. Phil made the decision to develop the almond cheese for his company. So, with a name change and the ramping up of production, it was just a short time before The Original Almond® was on the market with four new flavors. Now after more than 40 years “The Original Almond ® ” has become one of the top selling lines nationally.
The family’s solid success continued. In 1993, with the completion of a major expansion, the company was positioned with cutting edge processing machinery, production rooms, coolers and freezers, which would facilitate the company’s growth for the next several years.
In 1996 Phil and Norma’s daughter, Teresa, joined the family business as the company’s first full time sales person. In a short time, she became national sales manager. She continues to play a major role in the company, working with domestic accounts and bringing the company’s high quality products to new international markets.
After 20 years of doing business as P.J. Lisac & Associates Inc., the company officers felt it was time for a change. Phil Lisac came up with the idea of combining his last name “Lisac” with his wife Norma’s maiden name “Simonatti”, which seemed obvious because of the huge joint effort and commitment that was put into creating a new business from the ground up “together”. The new name was filed and from that point forward their company would be Lisanatti Foods® .
In 1998, Phil and Teresa met with a long-time customer specializing in natural products who was considering a new rice cheese. Phil said he could provide it, and confirmed with Jim that indeed they could. In a few short weeks the new product was presented to the retailer, who was thrilled with the company’s speed, and the product’s high quality. The first order was issued and RiceCheeze® was launched in the Northwest.
By 1999 more office space was needed. A 2000 square-foot storage loft was fully renovated, with a conference room, break area, bathrooms and new offices. With this, every space in the building was now supporting the continued growth of the family business.
Freeway expansions in 2005 required a new location for Lisanatti® Foods. An extensive search resulted in moving the offices to Oregon City, while manufacturing and logistics remained in Clackamas. Operations continued at the two locations until remodeling was completed, and in January 2007, the balance of equipment and inventory began moving to the new Oregon City location. This brought the entire organization back together under one roof.
Things have continued to thrive, with Phil as CEO and founder. Norma retired in 2016 after 40 years as the company’s secretary and treasurer. Jeff serves as President, and is credited with automating many areas and creating new formulations while improving on the solid financial positon that Phil built.

Set up by its current Chairman, Christopher Dawson, in 1993, Clearspring has grown from annual sales of £640,000 to monthly sales of £750,000 in 2013.

Liang Yi Food Industries Pte. Ltd,"Liang Yi Food Industries Pte. Ltd, formerly known as Liang Yi Food Processing and Look Front Trading is established since 1988 where we first started our production in Bangkok, Thailand. During our establishment in Thailand, we possessed a large proportion of market share. Advanced facilities were also introduced from Taiwan and laboratories were set up for research and development of healthy vegetarian food products using sophisticated techniques.
In year 2000, another manufacturing factory was set up in Singapore. After researching the market demand, we began to explore the sales market in both production and distribution businesses. Our products are not only sold in local food centres, but also widely distributed in local supermarkets such as Fairprice and Sheng Siong. Since then, Liang Yi grew a wide consumer base and we started to tap in overseas markets. In year 2005, we started to search for collaboration opportunities in Taiwan and Shanghai to undertake further development of vegetarian products. We are prepared to explore a bigger market based on estimated market demand.
Liang Yi is a manufacturer of various types of vegetarian products such as Texture Vegetable Protein (TVP), konjac, mushroom and wheat gluten.

All ingredients are fulfilling our ambitious organic and additive-free standards.
The cows at the dairy farm, that give us their fresh milk, are fed only with GMO, fertilizer and pesticide free food, grown at own meadows.

After this our tofu maker scoops the curd into a muslin cloth lined settling box, tops with a pressing lid and heavy weight and its left to rest for a while. During this time the curds are firmed and we ensure it is pressed for just the right amount of time to get just the right firmness and texture to our delicious tofu.

Worthington,"Worthington Foods, Inc., has grown from a tiny manufacturer of specialty foods into a leader of the U.S. markets for vegetarian foods and meat alternatives. The business traces its heritage to 1939, when Dr. George T. Harding III founded Special Foods in Worthington, Ohio. Harding established Special Foods to supply vegetarian foods to his father’s nearby sanitarium (health spa). With companies like Michigan’s Battle Creek Foods Company, Tennessee’s Madison Foods, and California’s Loma Linda Foods as models, Harding, his wife Mary Virginia, and four other investors bought and refurbished a fire-damaged house and started production in 1939.
Special Foods’ early products were fashioned after “nut meats,” first concocted by Dr. John Kellogg, the first Adventist to become a medical doctor. They combined roasted peanuts with gluten (derived from flour) and seasonings to form meatless, yet high-protein main courses like PROAST, a substitute for dark meat, and NUMETE, a substitute for light meat.
Worthington Foods was aquired by Heritage Health Food in 2016, and continues to innovate and grow in the vegetarian food industry.
Worthington is committed to producing high quality, vegetarian products to promote healthful living. Aspiring to be the “World’s Best!”, Worthington seeks to expand the options for those pursuing a meatless, plant based lifestyle and satisfy the tastebuds of all who partake.",eatworthington.com,Food and beverages,United States,1939,End-consumer brands & products,Plant-based,"Soy, Wheat",,"Burger, Deli, Meat & fish, Minced/Ground meat, Salami, Sausage, Steak","Beef, Chicken, Pork, Poultry, Turkey"

LikeMeat products are now becoming available throughout Europe and the US and soon everyone will be able to experience the taste, convenience and health of a plant-protein future.

There’s no sacrifice, because our products have all the texture and flavours that make your mouth water, and there’s no guilt at the grill. We’re not a meat substitute, but an obvious choice. We don’t want to change ourselves – we just want to change our menu.
At LikeMeat we continually evaluate how we work and look for ways how we can become even better and more sustainable.

Bolthouse Farms,"Our story begins in 1915 in Grant, Michigan where the Bolthouse family started farming vegetables. When William Herman Bolthouse took over the farm from his parents in 1938, he expanded and focused on the production and distribution of carrots.

In 1973, a second facility in Bakersfield, California was opened where year-round production was possible allowing broader distribution.
In the 1990s, Bolthouse Farms brought a breakthrough product to the marketplace. Frustrated with the waste in the carrot business, a local Bolthouse Farms grower peeled and cut “ugly” carrots into pieces and sold them in bags.

Almost all Vivera products contain vitamin B12 and the mineral iron. Vitamin B12 plays an important role in the building of tissue.

Sustainability
Vivera is conscious of its social responsibility and is therefore always looking for sustainable solutions related to all areas of its industrial processes. In our new production factory numerous measures have been taken to minimise CO2-emissions.
Another example is that the dishes in which the Vivera products are placed are made from recyclable PET material.
The cardboard packaging is made from cardboard approved by the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council). The wood from which this cardboard is made originates from woodlands managed in accordance with the sustainable principles of the FSC.
Vivera applies very strict regulations regarding the purchasing of all its raw materials and consumables. The most important raw material for the Vivera products are soy beans.
The soy that is used to produce the Vivera products is derived from sustainable non-genetically modified soy beans.

We believe that it’s possible to be happy and healthy even without animal products.

Dr. Praeger's,"It’s not every day that two heart surgeons get into the food business, but over 20 years ago that’s exactly what our dads did. Motivated by what they saw in their practice, our parents set out on a mission to encourage sensible eating. They knew ingredients had to be nutritious and simple, that everything had to be delicious, and that their products needed to be super simple to make. While the world has changed since our little family business first got started, our focus remains true to our dads’ vision and we work every day to make them proud.
Our history dates back to 1992 when our dads, medical partners and cardiothoracic surgeons, conducted emergency surgery to save a man’s life. They wound up also saving a business. After a successful operation, the group became friends. Later, the patient introduced our dads to the owner of Ungar’s Heimeshe Gefilte Fish Company. They were hooked.
After acquiring the company (while keeping their busy medical practice) the pair launched Dr. Praeger’s Sensible Foods to provide nutritious, delicious, and convenient frozen foods. The idea was to offer food that tasted so good it’d be much easier to help people to adopt better eating habits.
Now, two decades later, the next generation is at the helm, inspired by and true to the original mission and values. We’re still an independent, family-owned and operated business grounded in using simple, whole ingredients to make great-tasting products families love. We’re continually working to expand our range of products to add new flavors and options that are as delicious to eat as they are easy to serve.
We want to contribute to people’s ability to live their lives to the fullest! The biggest impact we can make is by delivering the most delicious recipes made from simple, nutritious foods that help encourage good eating habits that last a lifetime.

LoveSeitan,"We are the UK’s leading manufacturer of Seitan products.
LoveSeitan are the only bulk producer of seitan in the UK. We have developed a unique process for making seitan with unrivalled texture and flavour in our fully vegan, Grade A, BRC compliant facility. We supply food service, manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, restaurants, cafes and retail outlets
Seitan is quite simply a super healthy, low fat, plant-based, protein-rich food. Although it is made from wheat, seitan has very little in common with flour or bread. It is also known as “wheat meat”, “wheat protein” or “wheat gluten”. When cooked, seitan becomes quite similar to the look and texture of meat making it a popular and cruelty free substitute for vegans, vegetarians or anyone interested in a meat-free diet. Its dense firmness gives it a meat like texture when compared with tofu and tempeh.
Our founders, Nick and Steve, met in 2016 and quickly realised that it was almost impossible to buy seitan online other than pickled in jars. As committed vegans they wanted to do whatever they could to reduce and ultimately eliminate the consumption of animals and animal products by humans and thought that if they could provide a top quality vegan product, some may say “meat replacement”, then they could provide an alternative.
They decided to create a vegan food product that would provide a healthier and cruelty free alternative to existing animal based products and that would blow people’s minds. Nick, a genius in the kitchen, had for some time been experimenting and perfecting the art of producing the most amazing, flavoured & textured, home-made seitan. Steve had been searching for good quality, ready made seitan without much luck and so, the pair saw that they were on to something and, in August 2017, LoveSeitan was born.",loveseitan.com,Food and beverages,United Kingdom,2017,End-consumer brands & products,Plant-based,"Cereals, Wheat",,"Burger, Meat & fish, Ready-to-eat meals & snacks, Salami, Sausage, Tempeh",

For years, the team worked hard to perfect the recipe, avoiding industry shortcuts like gums, coloring agents, artificial flavors and added sugar. Instead, they carved their own path and added young plantains to enhance sweetness and texture, while providing a boost of natural prebiotics, a special form of dietary fiber that acts as food for probiotics. The result is one of the most nutritious plant-based yogurts on grocery shelves today, with more than 50 billion live, vegan probiotics to support gut health.

Soul Xocolatl,"Bliss was born from my own journey into health, many years of research, and the sacred path of motherhood. The motherhood led me to ask myself what were the best foods to offer to my baby in a world where most of the foods are compromised. While studying Holistic Nutrition, super foods, healing foods and kids nutrition, I have created a unique product to nourish myself and my baby, which later on became the signature product in my coaching program facilitating my client's health journey with great success.
""Seeking for years a healthy and nutritious xocolatl without finding anything on the market, nothing up to my standards for conscious living, nothing safe to offer to a child, intrigued, yet empowered, I was set out to find a better solution to share with the world... I discovered after, trying countless products that many of the natural and organic brands were either not really safe, raw, or they weren't really as organic as I would have liked. Feeling a little duped and upset, I've decided that I would have better control over the production and quality of the foods in my life if I created my own products, whether is xocolatl, skin care products, or any other food.""",soulxocolatl.com,Food and beverages,Romania,,End-consumer brands & products,Plant-based,"Cocoa, Seeds",,"Dairy, Ice-cream and desserts",

Mouse's Favourite,"Growing up in Jersey, famous for its pretty cows and their creamy milk, I understand that the appeal of dairy is more than just a taste people crave. A classic cheeseboard and its trimmings – glass of wine, fresh, crusty bread, a spoonful of chutney – is more than the sum of its parts; it’s nostalgia and it’s a familiar ritual that I want people to still be able to enjoy. I try to capture not only the flavours, but also the rustic visual beauty of traditional dairy cheese and its aesthetic shapes and forms, but in vegan versions.
My approach is to keep the process as pure as possible – leaving it to the various fermentation cultures and processes to create a subtle variety of flavours rather than by adding extra flavours in. At the same time, we’re in the midst of the pioneering era of vegan cheese and it’s exciting to try and come up with something entirely new. My aim is to balance the best parts of tradition with the foods and philosophies of the future.",mousesfavourite.com,Food and beverages,United Kingdom,2016,End-consumer brands & products,Plant-based,"Cashew, Coconut, Fruits, Nuts, Oilseeds, Rapeseed, Sunflower",,"Cheese, Dairy, Deli, Other",

Provitamil,"Provitamil Oat Drink is the fastest-growing brand, and the only UK-made product, in the alternative dairy market. So it's probably no surprise that the people behind it have an impeccably British pedigree.
The team is led by Simon Hardy, Founder of Norfolk-based DrinksBrokers Ltd which specialises in marketing and distributing soft drinks. After building a strong reputation in wine and beer sales, Simon moved to cider-maker HP Bulmer to develop sales of its soft drinks range, including high-profile brands such as Orangina, Perrier and Volvic.
'Interesting' soft drinks
After honing his skills, Simon and partner David Diggens (now retired) set-up DrinksBrokers to bring ""new, interesting and different soft drink products to the UK market"". In fact, their earliest success was sourcing supply supply of sterilised milk for the supermarket giant Asda Walmart, something they still do today.
As consumers began actively looking for alternatives to dairy products, the team started work for Europe's largest supplier of oats-based drinks. ""Although they dominated the market, I thought I could make a better product here in the UK"", says Simon.
Awesome oats
The team set-out to find a reliable partner that could prepare and pack the highest quality oat drink and, after more than a year of development, Provitamil was born.
Now Provitamil Oat Drink, which has been nominated in World Beverage Innovation Awards 2014 in Best new brand or business (click here for more details), can be found on the shelves of more than 2,200 supermarkets and health food stores across the UK, with new flavours and other alternatives being developed all the time.

Klein’s Ice Cream,"Klein’s, a name synonymous for the fine kosher ice cream and frozen fun across the continent, is a family owned business for more than six decades. Our rich history is a woven tapestry of decades of family dedication and commitment to preserve & please the kosher consumer.
In 1955, the crown of the Klein family, Rabbi Efraim Klein, began Klein’s Ice Cream in the humble accomodations of his tiny home and with a single truck that barely ran. Rabbi Efraim, despite his horrific years enduring the Holocaust and losing his entire family, was determined to succeed and rebuild from scratch. A man of rock solid faith and keen foresight, his vision of establishing the first kosher Chalav Yisoroel ice cream company began blossoming to fruition.
With Mr. Klein’s dream alive, our strong family business is in its third generation, passed down from father to son to grandchilren. Klein’s is not merely a business, it’s a family owned company where an entire family devotedly puts heart and sould into every aspect of the business and ensures that Klein’s tradition remains a family success. We are the FIRST FAMILY OF FINE KOSHER ICE CREAM and rightfully so; united, committed and loyal to our father’s vision to make kosher ice cream a priority.
Klein’s was the first company to produce kosher ice cream and at Klein’s no money or time is spared when it comes to ensuring that every one of our items is 100% kosher ceritfied. Under the professional leadership of the world famous CRC organization and Rabbi Eckstien, a dynamic kashrus expert, our standards remain a top priority in which we take much pride in.
In the last decade millions of Americans are concerned about food safety issues and about the standards of commercial food. That is why the market for kosher food has gone through tremendous growth. A kosher food item is produced with careful supervision and each ingredient is scrutinized for quality and safety purposes.
Why Chalav Yisroel ice cream? What is its uniqueness that millions are seeking worldwide? It begins with secluding cows destined to produce milk for kosher ice cream. A kashrus supervisor tends to these cows all throughout the entire process of milking the cows to the packaging of the milk. This ensures that only healthy cows are used and that premiummilk caters solely for our productions. Klein’s ice cream carries an underlying message, that its ingredients are cautiously analyzed and carefully selected. Our consumers are fully confident with the knowledge that every one of our hundreds of items is a guaranteed, certified kosher premium product.
A much sought after product is our fabulous unique VEGAN approved Smooth & Creamy ice cream that has changed the way ice cream tastes. Our selection of mouth watering non dairy flavors have turned our Smooth & Creamy items into one of our number one seller. Designed for vegetarians and for the lactose intolerant population, its indeed a pride and joy.
We are confident you will be impressed with the vast selection of items, from classic traditions to trendy creations. Our pristine reputation for producing the best tasting frozen desserts crystallizes itself in the heart of every product. From premium sorbets to rich dairy ice cream, Smooth & Creamy to frozen fun, famous novelties to elegant desserts, Klein’s has epitomized fine ice cream for nearly a century.

For all of history, across the planet human beings have used animal protein to impart deliciousness and enhance the flavor of a wide range of foods. While the ""meat replacement"" space is growing at an unprecedented pace, most meat-analogues cannot emulate this central function animal protein plays in our food system. Meanwhile, our scope of plant-based deliciousness-enhancing foods is alarmingly narrow and limited to industrial materials (MSG, E627, etc.), Products from Southeast Asia with limited flavor profiles and and low-quality products with inferior flavor.
To reduce our dependence on animal protein, there is an immense need today to develop excellent plant-based products that impart and enhance flavor to a wide range of foods; naturally produced, healthy, richly flavored, highly nutritious, and most importantly - incredibly delicious.

A call from a head chef in a global merchant bank restaurant, trying to establish healthy eating menus in the workplace, led us to establish our client base amongst contract caterers. By the year 2000 we were selling our vegetarian recipes to virtually every major contract caterer within the UK, together with hotels, colleges, independent restaurants and catering groups.
Today, we are the UK’s premier specialist vegetarian and vegan food distributors within the foodservice sector.

Following the success of the first hamburger, we created Mosa Meat to commercialise cultured meat (also known as clean meat, cultivated meat or cell-based meat) and bring it to plates everywhere.

Zen Burger,"Having followed her own journey towards healing from severe asthma and allergies as a child, Carla’s quest to understand what is forking up our health, led her to a fervent mission to empower our family of humanity with real organic crave-able nut-plant-based recipes that are touted by even hardcore omnivores to be “so crave-able you’ll never miss meat.” Carla’s unrelenting desire for truth uncovered a deep knowledge of toxic ingredients that have created “a sickcare system” that is directly related to systemic soil devastation that began with GMO’s, glyphosate and neurotoxic ingredients creating the unperfect storm to unleash a pandemic explosion of chronic disease. Leading endocrinologists warn that by 2060 our human population will no longer be able to reproduce and that by 2035, together, we will face a full health and economic collapse with 1 in every 3 children being devastated by autism and 1 in every 2 children to adults have cancer. This is the tip of the iceberg. “Never before have we faced together a pandemic explosion of disease which now threatens our very survival. Our ignorance is no longer bliss, it is deadly. “Know thy ingredients. All life depends on it.” Sizzling marketing ads with paid-for celebrity endorsements selling us “frankenmeats” as protein’s future, is not the answer or solution to the very real perils we face together around animal agriculture. For decades, dairy and meat ads are “engineered” to evoke sentiments of family, love, nourishment, telling us what does our body good.
Six years into my journey, then came my awakening to the truth that “The Dirty Dozen” or “Clean 15” didn’t protect my body from glyphosate and other deadly neurotoxins being sprayed all over my garbanzo beans (hummus) as a “drying” agent and tragically I learned that this deadly neurotoxin was everywhere, tested in every non-organic hummus—WTF! If it wasn’t organic, there was no protection… OHHHH MY!!! As a documentary filmmaker and lover of truth “down the rabbit hole I went” and interviewed our world’s leading endocrinologists to learn that the pandemic explosion of chronic disease, cancer and autism is traceable to the exact moment that GMO’s and glyphosate entered our soil/plant food supply… Glyphosate is a classified water-soluble antibiotic medicine and it’s lurking in nearly every non-organic food we’re putting into our bodies. GLYPHOSATE DESTROYS YOUR GUT BIOME. YIKES! NOT OK!! AND, NO PROBIOTICS IS NOT ENOUGH!
Six years into what I now call “A Food Industry Gone Sour,” I’ve learned that there’s a lot of marketing celeb sizzle and hundreds of millions of dollars being poured into new beyond impossible for our bodies to assimilate these man-made highly processed nutrient-void glyphosate rich “frankenmeats” touting to be the “solution” and protein’s future. This is a 100% absolute abomination to our body temple’s health and a devastating disaster to our planet and all sentient life as well. Once I woke up to the franken-horrors of ingredients laced in the health slaughter of even our “plant-based” foods, I set out on a mission to fuel my passion for cooking and sharing truth, to help us all wake up to unite to make a difference in our world—for the sake of my children, our fur babies and my grandchildren’s children.
Some have argued, if I’m saving an animal’s life than I’m OK with eating these artificial man-made meats.

Zero Waste. Protein extraction discards other valuable nutrients such as fiber and loses up to 25% protein during processing. Planetarians keeps all other nutrients in place.
Low Sodium. Soy Concentrates (900mg/100g) and Isolates (1005 mg/100g) are higher in sodium, which is used for leaching. Planetarians’ chemical-free process leaves 3 mg/100g of protein.
Water-efficient. Planetarians’ process uses 7 liters of water only, compared to 30 liter for Concentrates and 40 liters for Isolates per kg of protein.
Methyl-cellulose and Gluten-free. The fiber kept in protein allows creating a muscle-like texture without extra chemicals and keeps the label clean.
Affordable without losing protein quality. The low waste process brings the costs down and makes proteins affordable for consumers.

The Amazing Protein Co,"Years ago in the redwood forests of Santa Cruz, California, an intrepid cook wanted his young children to enjoy foods from all over the world. But his kids didn’t eat meat and it was hard to find a protein that could be used to make curries and stir fries as well as barbecue and burgers. So he set out to make one himself. Fifteen years and thousands of dinners later, Lika® was born. Lika® remained a favorite of family and friends for over a decade, when a friend suggested the rest of the world might like a taste. As it turns out, Lika® does more than make delicious burgers, meatballs and curries— it also helps people and the planet. With no fat, no cholesterol and using 1,800 fewer gallons of water per pound than beef with zero land destruction in the process, Lika® is as good for your health and the planet as it is for your taste buds! We didn’t set out to change the world, we just wanted better food for kids. When we learned what a difference Lika® could make for our children and the world they’ll inherit, our simple motto was born: Better food for a better world.

The company produces and markets a highly functional chickpea protein isolate boasting a uniquely concentrated protein load (above 90%). Offering a vegetable-based, non-allergenic protein isolate for infusion into a versatile array of food applications, it has a neutral flavor thanks to breakthrough, IP-protected technology, setting a new standard of pure protein solutions.
The high solubility and smooth viscosity of the unique isolate form enables ChickP proteins to be integrated into virtually any matrix and is especially well-suited for meat and dairy analogs. It provides a powerful protein boost to beverages, pastries, snacks and more. Food companies integrating ChickP protein into their products benefit from shorter, cleaner labels, as its neutral flavor eliminates the need for masking agents and additives.

Reifen’s goal was to help alleviate malnutrition while concurrently benefitting consumers and food manufactures with a convenient implementation platform. The chickpea team is comprised of world-renowned foodTech biotech and nutrition experts who invested years of research at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In a joint effort they developed the patented technology for extracting maximum protein with unsurpassed functional, nutritional, and organoleptic qualities.
ChickP’s line of innovative GMO-free chickpea isolates includes purified native starch fractions. This portfolio ardently exploits all extractable chickpea elements. It reduces food waste and maintains a sustainable, clean ingredient produced entirely according to environmental and ethical values.

Biocatalysts wealth of enzyme knowledge and experience, along with our continuous investment in new technology and capabilities, enables us to continuously exceed our customers’ enzyme expectations.",biocatalysts.com,Food and beverages,United Kingdom,1986,Ingredients & inputs,"Fermentation, Plant-based",,"Host strain development, Target molecule selection",,
Kagome,"Ichitaro Kanie, Kagome's founder, first succeeded in cultivating tomatoes in his garden in Japan in 1899. His success led to the formation of Kagome Co., Ltd. now one of the largest producers of tomato products in Japan.
In 1988, Kagome Japan established Kagome Inc. (Kagome) in Los Banos, California. The state-of-the-art production facility was completed in 1990, and we began shipping sauces to restaurant chains across the nation. Today, Kagome is known as one of the premier customized sauce developers and manufacturers for foodservice, servicing customers domestically and as far away as Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Australia.
To meet growing demand, Kagome has increased capacity at the Los Banos facility and in 2007 acquired Kagome Foods. This acquisition has optimized distribution in the eastern portion of the U.S, and provided new product and packaging types to our Kagome portfolio.
As international foodservice markets emerge, Kagome has followed strategies to best service those markets. Inner Mongolia Kagome Foods Inc., was established in 2005, in the most desirable tomato growing region in China. Then shortly thereafter, in the European Union, Kagome became a major shareholder in an organization formed by the merger of two major Portuguese tomato processing companies, Italagro and F.I.T. With Kagome Japan's extensive resources across the globe in ingredient sourcing and manufacturing technologies we have successfully extended our international business initiatives, bringing the good taste of Kagome to every corner of the world.",kagomeusa.com,Food and beverages,United States,1989,"Contract manufacturing, End-consumer brands & products",Plant-based,Sunflower,,Oils and fats,
