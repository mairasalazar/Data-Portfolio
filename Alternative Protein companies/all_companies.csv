Alpro,"We were born plant-based, way back in 1980, and we’ve been banging that big, plant-based drum ever since. Our mission is the same now as it was then. To make delicious food that’s healthy for you and healthy for the planet.
We’ve come a long way since soya was the only plant-based kid on the block. From breakfast bowl to dreamy after dinner desserts, we’ve got you covered. We’ve added oats, rice, almonds, hazelnuts and coconut to our list of base ingredients. Good food starts with good ingredients. That’s why we shop local whenever we can and work closely with our farmers. Rainforest free non-GMO soya, Mediterranean almonds mostly watered by rain and naturally pollinated by insects, European oats, and the best hazelnuts, coconuts, rice and cashews we can find.
Who’d have thought that Belgian born Alpro would grow into something this big, all over Europe and in 50 countries around the world. In 2017 we joined the even bigger Danone family and added our plant-based placard to their ‘Food Revolution’ march. It’s a natural fit as we both share a single aim – what’s best for people and for the planet.
In for a professional challenge? Join our vibrant teams and feel the Alpro vibe of positivism and openness, collaboration and passion for quality.
We believe that everyone has talent, something which comes natural to you. Your uniqueness is something which brings both excellence as well as energizes you.
By joining us you will become part of one of the leading and most innovative food companies in the world, a diverse network of talents, with whom you’ll be able to share your experience and learn from theirs.
We have a lot in scope for you regarding learning and development, but we can also offer interesting mobility programs, many new positions and geographies, for those who like to grow.",1980.0,Vandemoortele Groep,"Dairy, Ice-cream and desserts, Milk, Yogurt",Food and beverages,End-consumer brands & products,Plant-based,"Almond, Cashew, Coconut, Hazelnut, Oat, Rice, Soy",,,,alpro.com,,Wevelgem,Belgium,Europe

Bio Tech Foods,"Ethicameat is the cultured meat brand of Biotech Foods, a pioneering Spanish company that is driving a revolution in the global food market; natural slaughter-free animal meat.
In a world threatened by climate change, a growing population represents a challenge when it comes to combining food and sustainability. Therefore, cultured meat is positioned as one of the greatest innovations of the century, combining food safety, animal welfare and sustainability in a unique product that is perfect for the whole family.
We respond to global and ethical arguments, address high demand for animal-based protein and reduce the current impact of the production process on the environment through sustainable solutions.
We are a friendly response coming from responsibility and awareness, courageous, disruptive, innovative and different, compared to intensive meat production, which has reached its limit.
We are tied to the social movement from many corners of the globe that advocates for responsible consumption as a way of reconsidering our needs in order to satisfy them with a healthy and sustainable diet that is fair on animal welfare and the environment.
Ethicameat is a real brand and also a quality seal for sustainable meat.",2017.0,Mercedes Vila Juárez,"Meat & fish, Minced/Ground meat",Food and beverages,End-consumer brands & products,Cultivated,,,,Beef,biotech-foods.com,,San Sebastián,Spain,Europe

iwi,"At iwi® (“ee-wee”), our purpose is: “together we create sustainable food solutions for everyone and our planet.” We are an experienced team of farmers, scientists and food industry leaders working hard to bring plant-based products to consumers around the world. Our secret ingredient is algae, which is packed with nutrients like omega-3s and protein, and uses resources that otherwise would not be utilized – like non-fertile land and salt water – to grow. Most people don’t realize that algae is the original source of omega-3s, the essential fatty acids critical for human health and wellbeing. Our algae requires no fresh water to grow, and is about 300 times more productive than peas in terms of production of essential amino acids. Our omega-3 supplements are available nationwide at Whole Foods, Sprouts, Vitamin Shoppe, Amazon and other fine retailers. They are vegan, non-GMO and 100% sustainable. (Clinical studies confirm that humans can absorb more omega-3s from iwi than from fish or krill oil.) We are also developing new plant-based protein products, such as functional foods, snacks and supplements. At iwi, we are committed to the rural communities around our Texas and New Mexico farms, creating jobs both directly and indirectly, and leading a movement that we call Social Sustainability.

CHKP Foods,"Our founders are Middle East natives. And as such, they’ve always been well-acquainted with a certain little legume: the chickpea. Growing up with chickpeas as a staple food, they admired the taste, versatility, and nutritiousness of these plant-based powerhouses.
And, as lovers of a good challenge, they wondered –– what if we could transform this incredible ingredient into smooth, nutritious non-dairy yogurt like nothing else that exists? What if we could create dairy-free deliciousness that’s unrecognizable from this center-plate protein, except for its amazing benefits for people and planet?
And from this idea sprang a mission: to create dairy-free options SO good that you can choose them for all the right reasons: amazing taste, creamy texture, joyful indulgence, and true nourishment. No sacrifice, no compromise.
Flash forward through years of R&D to present day: we couldn’t be more excited to have unlocked the secret creaminess of chickpeas to bring you the kind of dairy-free indulgence that inspired us in the first place. Our products have the taste and texture you crave, protein and probiotics to nourish you, and a sustainability story worth telling.

No more synthetic or unsustainable methods & processes.TeOra takes on this global challenge and aims to lead the design & delivery of precision fermentation-based ingredients & proprietary biofactories. When there is a blueprint available in Nature, TeOra aims to biomanufacture with it.
'Ora’ or 'Aura' translates to “Life Force” in many native tribal languages. Most of these indigenous communities pride themselves in their symbiotic relationship with the natural world.These sentiments resound strongly in their responsible production and consumption practices to protect our planet's life-supporting capacity.
Motivated by such beliefs, TeOra uses Nature’s ingenuine biological processes as a guide to enable the clean and sustainable production of compounds & peptides.

Our newest addition to the Abe’s line, Abe’s Mom’s, are muffins that are not only vegan, but gluten-free as well. Abe’s Vegan Muffins are produced in a nut-free and sesame-free facility.
The real Abe is the inspiration behind every one of our products. You see, Abe is lactose intolerant and anaphylactic to nuts, seeds and eggs. At school and everywhere else, Abe was left out due to his food allergies. In a fit of inspiration, Joby (Abe’s Dad) and Marty (Abe’s Uncle) created a line of muffins so that Abe (and everyone alike) can feel like one of the gang.

Deep Branch,"Deep Branch is a carbon dioxide recycling company that uses microorganisms to convert clean CO2 into high-quality products to enable global sustainable animal nutrition. Founded in 2018, the company is a fast-growing startup operating in both the UK and the Netherlands.
The sustainability of animal farming and broader concerns regarding the reduction of emissions are two of the biggest problems of our time. By 2050 the world’s carbon emissions must be net-zero to avoid environmental catastrophe, yet by this point, our planet’s population is predicted to increase by a third. With average consumption of animal products increasing, it’s thought that the output of animal farming will have to double to meet demand.
Of the total emissions associated with the average person, approximately one quarter comes from diet and the majority of those emissions are associated with animal products. Although at Deep Branch we recognise the best way to reduce dietary carbon intensity is to reduce meat consumption, we’re pragmatic in recognising that not everyone sees it this way. At Deep Branch, we’re tackling this problem through the development of Proton™, our single-cell protein.
We have partnered with two multinational animal feed producers to co-develop Proton™-based feeds for use in aquaculture and poultry. Over the next two years, we’ll be scaling our output and working together to finalise feed formulations for an anticipated 2023 market launch. Rather than relying on the conventional protein sources of protein, fishmeal and soy, which are often shipped from South America, Proton™-based feeds can be produced from locally sourced ingredients with 90% less carbon intensity. Proton™ is not just dramatically more sustainable, it’s also cost-competitive, making the transition to Proton™-based feeds an easy decision to make.",2018.0,,,Animal feed and pet food,Ingredients & inputs,Fermentation,CO2,,,,deepbranch.com,,,United Kingdom,Europe

Lycored,"Nutrition isn’t complicated. For us, it’s natural.
We’ve been a leader in the research and development of carotenoid-based products for the last two decades and we take that role very seriously. This means we approach everything we do with a sense of wonder and a driving desire to find the best possible outcome or create the highest-quality product.
Sometimes we begin with an actual seed (from one of our tomato farms) and sometimes we start with the seed of an idea—maybe a health-related concern or even a question that was posed by one of our scientists on a quick coffee break. No matter how the process starts, we always go through extensive and time-consuming testing procedures, studies, and periods of refinement before ever bringing anything to market.
Our process takes a long time. And no, it’s not the easy way to do things. But when you’re fully committed to what you’re creating, you don’t mind putting in those extra hours, days, and years.
All of this work can lead any number of places. Sometimes it leads us to a brilliant and unexpected new discovery like our microencapsulation technique (which keeps ingredients stable and releases them slowly into the body) and of course all-new products (like our vegan-friendly red colorant). We devote ourselves fully to everything we make because manufacturing a proven-effective supplement isn’t enough.

We have not only found the sexual mating cycle but also discovered the optimum conditions for sexual reproduction. We have bred over 120 new strains and through working with cheese producers selected the optimum strains for cheese production. The launch of a natural and novel range of starter cultures is an industry first.
These unique new cultures are predicted to re-invigorate the blue cheese category that has seen little innovation or differentiation for decades. Not only is this a worldwide first to market but it is a first-time production of blue cheese starter cultures for the UK.

ORF Genetics,"A privately-owned Icelandic company established in 2001. ORF Genetics Ltd. is a pioneer in genetic science committed to developing innovative, economically viable and enabling solutions to produce recombinant proteins more efficiently and safely than other protein expression systems. ORF Genetics developed for this purpose the unique expression system Orfeus™ that uses barley grain as a vehicle for recombinant protein production which has proven to be particularly effective in the expression of growth factors and cytokines.

Stockeld Dreamery (formerly Noquo Foods),"We love cheese. We love yoghurt. Ice cream too, and so many other animal based products that are fundamental to our culture and heritage. But using animals to produce these treats is extremely wasteful and destructive.
In early 2019 we, Sorosh Tavakoli and Anja Leissner, founded Stockeld Dreamery (formerly Noquo Foods) to challenge the status quo and reinvent the foods we love, starting with cheese.
Stockeld Dreamery is a company where doers dare to dream, but even more so – where dreamers dare to do. We have a strong conviction that tastier and more nutritious alternatives to our favourite foods can be developed, we just haven’t tried hard enough. Our first vision is to create the world's most ambitious cheese. In 2021 we are launching our very first product to give you a taste of what we've been dreaming of.
Stockeld Dreamery is head-quartered in Stockholm, Sweden. Ready to share with the world our new take on cheese.

Hennig-Olsen Is,"Vil du jobbe med Kremen av iskrem?
Noen morgener er duften av ekte vanilje det første som møter deg når du går på jobb på iskremfabrikken i Hannevika. En sensorisk start på dagen som minner oss på hva Kremen av iskrem er og skal være: ekte råvarer, gode øyeblikk og solid håndverk gjort av dyktige ansatte. Summen av dette er deilig iskrem med den beste smaken.
Hennig-Olsen Is er en familiebedrift med tredje og fjerde generasjon Hennig-Olsen i sving på fabrikken. Siden 1924 har vi produsert fantastisk iskrem på fabrikken i Kristiansand. I tillegg til hovedkontoret i Kristiansand, har vi regionskontorer i Oslo, Haugesund, Bergen, Molde, Trondheim og Tromsø.
Nå, nær hundre år etter, står vi for halvparten av iskremen som spises i Norge. Et iskremeventyr!

Vi sier ofte at våre produkter er laget av iskremelskere for iskremelskere. Og ikke bare elsker vi iskrem, vi elsker jobben vår! Samholdet og trivselen på Hennig-Olsen Is er høy, og vi har det gøy på jobb.
På Hennig-Olsen Is har vi tradisjon for å ha mange nasjonaliteter i arbeid på iskremfabrikken. I 2016 mottok vi Mangfoldprisen, og i dag jobber over 20 ulike nasjonaliteter her i Hannevika. Likeverd og respekt for ulikheter er hvem vi er, og mangfoldet vårt en konkurransekraft.

Manus Bio,"It is estimated that the world’s population will increase by more than 35% by 2050, reaching 9 billion people. Crop production will need to more than double in order to feed these people and meet the consumer needs of a developing world. With very little land remaining for agricultural expansion, we as a society need to find ways to maximize the use of our world’s resources.
Plants produce a variety of rare natural products which are used in our daily lives as flavors, fragrances, food ingredients, cosmetics, vitamins, pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals. We strive to reduce our dependence on land- and resource-intensive practices by recreating natural processes through biotechnology.
SUSTAINABILITY: We provide a renewable and stable supply of natural plant ingredients through fermentation, which frees up agricultural land for food production and protects non-cultivatable plant species from extinction.
ACCESS: We reduce costs by more than 10-fold, allowing easier adoption and access to these natural ingredients across the world. We also ensure consistent quality and dependable quantities no matter what the adverse environmental or climate conditions (droughts, frost, diseases) might be.
DIVERSITY: Replicating plant natural processes in bacteria allows us to benefit from nature’s enormous diversity without threatening natural ecosystems and existing biodiversity.

White Dog Labs,"White Dog Labs, Inc. (WDL) was established in 2012 on the foundation of harnessing natural microorganism diversity to address global challenges in food sustainability, climate change and general human and animal nutrition. The company goes beyond discovery to also design and scale bioprocesses with end product application in mind.
Core to WDL discovery is our proprietary Protocol B™ process coupled with additional high-throughput selection techniques for the isolation and cultivation of microbiome-derived anaerobic microorganisms. Our approaches result in large, diverse and novel strain libraries informed through emerging applications in microbiome science, and yield promising solutions for animal nutrition and health. WDL has also advanced synthetic biology tools for Clostridia, thus coupling boundless natural diversity with directed innovation.
WDL has also invented a novel class of fermentation technology called MixoFerm™ that allows cultivation of previously “unculturable” bacteria while also improving the carbon efficiency of fermentation processes by 50 to 100%. MixoFerm is demonstrating the potential for unprecedented yields of bio-products on numerous sugar feedstocks, which improves economics for biobased production of products ranging from fuels and chemicals to protein ingredients and animal feed additives.
From its headquarters in New Castle, Delaware, WDL has scaled several animal nutrition products to multi-ton per month production scale, and is completing engineering on our first production facility in Nebraska.

Suomisen Maito Oy (JYMY),"Just a cows gallop away from the dairy-farm, in the village of Aura, we found suitable premises for our new organic ice cream company. An old candy-factory nearby, where the famous Finnish Sisu – candies once were made, is now the home of JYMY, possibly the best Finnish ice cream.
The most genuine ice cream comes from the organic milk, that is brought to us on the morning, freshly milked, from cows gallop away, from the Suominen´s dairy-farm. In our small ice cream factory it meets the wild and pure berries, roasted coffee-beans, dark chocolate, vanilla – all of entirely organic origin, too.
Flavors created with passion are then frozen to be the fresh, delicious Finnish JYMY ice cream.
Our philosophy on milk and berries is based on fresh and local organic production, delightfully combined with a variety of internationally acquired flavor-ingredients, also grown organically, chosen with care and devotion. All ingredients are fulfilling our ambitious organic and additive-free standards.
The cows at the dairy farm, that give us their fresh milk, are fed only with GMO, fertilizer and pesticide free food, grown at own meadows. The way we choose and prepare our ingredients, influences directly to the taste and structure of the ice cream.

Like Meat,"To create a future with a better way of eating for a greater way of life.
For us at LikeMeat it is about creating all the things that we love – chicken, kebabs, bratwurst – healthier and do it without losing any flavour or satisfaction. It’s not about creating a substitute. It’s about making amazing food.
LikeMeat products are now becoming available throughout Europe and the US and soon everyone will be able to experience the taste, convenience and health of a plant-protein future.
See you in the kitchen!
At LikeMeat, we want to change the way you eat, not change you. And it’s not so complicated. This is the 21st century and we believe that you should be able to eat well and live an enjoyable, healthy life with both old traditions and new habits. Not either/or. For this reason we have created a way of doing without meat on the menu – but not having to do without. There’s no sacrifice, because our products have all the texture and flavours that make your mouth water, and there’s no guilt at the grill. We’re not a meat substitute, but an obvious choice. We don’t want to change ourselves – we just want to change our menu.
At LikeMeat we continually evaluate how we work and look for ways how we can become even better and more sustainable.
No rainforest had to be destroyed for our soybeans, and the beans we use are GMO-free. In addition, our sleeve is supplied by an FSC certified manufacturer. This seal stands for “Forest Stewardship Council” and guarantees that wood and paper products come from responsibly managed forests. Our packaging trays are made from recycled materials, which our supplier processes with a special form of technology. This allows a reduction in the carbon footprint by up to 70% in comparison with non-recycled materials. A plant-based diet can lower the use of our resources.

Vegini,"The world is changing.
And so are we.
The thinking of new generations is going through a change of direction and catchwords like sustainability, environmental awareness, animal welfare and healthy living are no longer just terms, but new attitudes to life.
We support these changes with vegini – the new protein-rich way of pure pleasure.
vegini is not just “instead of meat” – vegini is so much more: 100% plant-based delight, made from pea protein, without added flavourings and preservatives. Furthermore, our products are protein-rich, free from soy, gluten and lactose and of course GMO-free. In a nutshell: good for you and your environment.

Cecily's,"You might have seen on our Instagram page that Coconuts Organic is now Cecily’s Ice cream.

The stuff you know and love.
The brand changeover is happening across all flavours, but this will take a bit of time. So you will still see Coconuts Organic tubs in M&S for the next month or so, and still receive Coconuts Organic tubs from website orders. We will soon have a brand new sparkling website to send out your favourite creamy plant-based ice cream.
Our aim has always been to bring you great-tasting, natural, plant-based ice cream which is so creamy and scoopy that you would not know it was dairy-free.

Co Yo,"COYO® founder Henry Gosling was born and raised in Fiji, the grandson of an island shipwrecked mariner from England, Captain Harry Gosling. He grew up in Suva and spent his school holidays wandering the coconut plantations of Savu Savu, surrounded by sprouting coconut saplings. As the eldest son of six children, his job was to collect coconuts for dinner, scrape out the succulent white flesh, grate it and squeeze it into milk for the family’s evening meal — usually a coconut curry. While kids in Australia shelled peas, Henry scraped coconuts. There was an implicit understanding amongst the Fijian people that coconuts were not only delicious, but very nourishing. Coconut milk, water, oil and flesh had sustained them for generations, but it would take many years before the science caught up with what the Fijians already knew.",2009.0,,"Dairy, Ice-cream and desserts, Yogurt",Food and beverages,End-consumer brands & products,Plant-based,Coconut,,,,coyo.com,,,United Kingdom,Europe

Zeastar,"Vegetarian Express was founded over 25 years ago in 1987 by David Jonas, a vegetarian for 30 years who, with a passion for environmental issues since the early 70’s started operations from the bedroom of a terraced house in Ilford, using just two chest freezers in the back garden.
Within a year, we had progressed to a small lock-up in Watford where our product range consisted of eight cook-chill vegetarian recipe meals, pre-prepared by a specialist vegetarian food manufacturer in Greenwich.
By the early 1990’s, we had crafted a niche for providing both advice and specialist ingredients within the health food trade. This is encapsulated by our strap line: “Suppliers and Consultants to the Catering Industry”- as true today as it was then.
A call from a head chef in a global merchant bank restaurant, trying to establish healthy eating menus in the workplace, led us to establish our client base amongst contract caterers. By the year 2000 we were selling our vegetarian recipes to virtually every major contract caterer within the UK, together with hotels, colleges, independent restaurants and catering groups.
Today, we are the UK’s premier specialist vegetarian and vegan food distributors within the foodservice sector. We have an extensive knowledge of our specialist products enabling us to offer advice on nutrition, menu planning - in order to help us exceed client's demands for exciting, innovative and healthy vegetarian and vegan menus.
Our aim is to promote and cater for the continually growing trend for healthy eating, with a particular focus on healthy eating in the work place. We are also specialists in ethnic ingredients with an excellent reputation for our extensive range of high quality authentic products.
There is a lot more work to be done in promoting healthier lifestyles, and we are at the forefront of this growing industry.
